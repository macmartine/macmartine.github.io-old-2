<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>So I found hypnosis to be a very interesting experience. All the time you’re saying to yourself, “I could do that, but I won’t”—which is just another way of saying that you can’t. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003V1WXKU&amp;location=945">945</a> ^ref-41019</p>

<p>And Von Neumann gave me an interesting idea: that you don’t have to be responsible for the world that you’re in.

But it was Von Neumann who put the seed in that grew into my active irresponsibility! — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003V1WXKU&amp;location=1905">1905</a> ^ref-36387</p>
