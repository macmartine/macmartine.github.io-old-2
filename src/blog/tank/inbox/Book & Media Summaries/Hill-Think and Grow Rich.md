## Highlights
I had learned, from years of experience with men, that when a man really desires a thing so deeply that he is willing to stake his entire future on a single turn of the wheel in order to get it, he is sure to win. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=198) ^ref-46345

It could not have been the young man’s appearance which got him his start in the Edison office, for that was definitely against him. It was what he thought that counted. — location: [201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=201) ^ref-7470

He did not say to himself, “Ah well, what’s the use? I guess I’ll change my mind and try for a salesman’s job.” But, he did say, “I came here to go into business with Edison, and I’ll accomplish this end if it takes the remainder of my life.” He meant it! What a different story men would have to tell if only they would adopt a definite purpose, and stand by that purpose until it had time to become an all-consuming obsession! — location: [210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=210) ^ref-23784

Before success comes in any man’s life, he is sure to meet with much temporary defeat, and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and most logical thing to do is to quit. That is exactly what the majority of men do. — location: [257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=257) ^ref-13640

---
More than five hundred of the most successful men this country has ever known, told the author their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them. Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of irony and cunning. It takes great delight in tripping one when success is almost within reach. — location: [258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=258) ^ref-47841

When you begin to think and grow rich, you will observe that riches begin with a state of mind, with definiteness of purpose, with little or no hard work. — location: [315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=315) ^ref-15131

He should have told us, that before we can accumulate riches in great abundance, we must magnetize our minds with intense desire for riches, that we must become “money conscious until the desire for money drives us to create definite plans for acquiring it. — location: [369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=369) ^ref-3175

Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his ships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win, essential to success. — location: [445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=445) ^ref-65471

---
Every human being who reaches the age of understanding of the purpose of money, wishes for it. Wishing will not bring riches. But desiring riches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning definite ways and means to acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which does not recognize failure, will bring riches. — location: [456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=456) ^ref-62374

---
The method by which desire for riches can be transmuted into its financial equivalent, consists of six definite, practical steps, viz: First. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire. It is not sufficient merely to say “I want plenty of money.” Be definite as to the amount. (There is a psychological reason for definiteness which will be described in a subsequent chapter). Second. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire. (There is no such reality as “something for nothing.) Third. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire. Fourth. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action. Fifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it. Sixth. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. As you read— see and feel and believe yourself already in possession of the money. — location: [458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=458) ^ref-18733

---
If you truly desire money so keenly that your desire is an obsession, you will have no difficulty in convincing yourself that you will acquire it. — location: [470](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=470) ^ref-31866

---
Back of all this demand for new and better things, there is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it. — location: [495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=495) ^ref-6800

---
There is a difference between Wishing for a thing and being ready to receive it. No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it. The state of mind must be belief, not mere hope or wish. Open-mindedness is essential for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief. — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=563) ^ref-37704

---
To all these I wish to convey the thought that all achievement, no matter what may be its nature, or its purpose, must begin with an intense, burning desire for something definite. — location: [719](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=719) ^ref-35053

“When men first come into contact with crime, they abhor it. If they remain in contact with crime for a time, they become accustomed to it, and endure it. If they remain in contact with it long enough, they finally embrace it, and become influenced by it.” This is the equivalent of saying that any impulse of thought which is repeatedly passed on to the subconscious mind is, finally, accepted and acted upon by the subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its physical equivalent, by the most practical procedure available. — location: [744](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=744) ^ref-43068

---
There are millions of people who believe themselves “doomed” to poverty and failure, because of some strange force over which they believe they have no control. They are the creators of their own “misfortunes,” because of this negative belief, which is picked up by the subconscious mind, and translated into its physical equivalent. This is an appropriate place at which to suggest again that you may benefit, by passing on to your subconscious mind, any desire which you wish translated into its physical, or monetary equivalent, in a state of expectancy or belief that the transmutation will actually take place. Your belief, or faith, is the element which determines the action of your subconscious mind. There is nothing to hinder you from “deceiving” your subconscious mind when giving it instructions through autosuggestion, as I deceived my son’s subconscious mind. To make this “deceit” more realistic, conduct yourself just as you would, if you were already in possession of the material thing which you are demanding, when you call upon your subconscious mind. The subconscious mind will transmute into its physical equivalent, by the most direct and practical media available, any order which is given to it in a state of belief, or faith that the order will be carried out. Surely, enough has been stated to give a starting point from which one may, through experiment and practice, acquire the ability to mix faith with any order given to the subconscious mind. Perfection will come through practice. It cannot come by merely reading instructions. — location: [757](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=757) ^ref-14241

faith is the “eternal elixir” which gives life, power, and action to the impulse of thought! — location: [779](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=779) ^ref-11717

---
faith is the starting point of all accumulation of riches! faith is the basis of all “miracles,” and all mysteries which cannot be analyzed by the rules of science! — location: [781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=781) ^ref-16867

If thoughts which are mixed with any of the feelings of emotions, constitute a “magnetic” force which attracts, from the vibrations of the ether, other similar, or related thoughts it is a well known fact that one comes, finally, to believe whatever one repeats to one’s self, whether the statement be true or false. If a man repeats a lie over and over, he will eventually accept the lie as truth. Moreover, he will believe it to be the truth. — location: [788](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=788) ^ref-56574

Every man is what he is, because of the dominating thoughts which he permits to occupy his mind. — location: [792](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=792) ^ref-6161

. A thought thus “magnetized” with emotion may be compared to a seed which, when planted in fertile soil, germinates, grows, and multiplies itself over and over again, until that which was originally one small seed, becomes countless millions of seeds of the same brand! — location: [795](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=795) ^ref-34548

---
Now, let us go back to the starting point, and become informed as to how the original seed of an idea, plan, or purpose may be planted in the mind. The information is easily conveyed: any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought. This is why you are asked to write out a statement of your major purpose, or Definite Chief Aim, commit it to memory, and repeat it, in audible words, day after day, until these vibrations of sound have reached your subconscious mind. — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=803) ^ref-33126

Go back to these six steps described in chapter two, and read them again, very carefully, before you proceed further. Then (when you come to it), read very carefully the four instructions for the organization of your “Master Mind” group, described in the chapter on Organized Planning. By comparing these two sets of instructions with that which has been stated on auto-suggestion, you, of course, will see that the instructions involve the application of the principle of auto-suggestion. Remember, therefore, when reading aloud the statement of your desire (through which you are endeavoring to develop a “money consciousness”), that the mere reading of the words is of No consequence— unless you mix emotion, or feeling with your words. If you repeat a million times the famous Emil Coué formula, “Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better,” without mixing emotion and faith with your words, you will experience no desirable results. Your subconscious mind recognizes and acts upon Only thoughts which have been well-mixed with emotion or feeling. — location: [1043](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1043) ^ref-8629

---
Let us here offer suggestions for the effective use of concentration. When you begin to carry out the first of the six steps, which instructs you to “fix in your own mind the exact amount of money you desire,” hold your thoughts on that amount of money by concentration, or fixation of attention, with your eyes closed, until you can actually see the physical appearance of the money. Do this at least once each day. As you go through these exercises, follow the instructions given in the chapter on faith, and see yourself actually in possession of the money! Here is a most significant fact— the subconscious mind takes any orders given it in a spirit of absolute faith, and acts upon those orders, although the orders often have to be presented over and over again, through repetition, before they are interpreted by the subconscious mind. Following the preceding statement, consider the possibility of playing a perfectly legitimate “trick” on your subconscious mind, by making it believe, because you believe it, that you must have the amount of money you are visualizing, that this money is already awaiting your claim, that the subconscious mind must hand over to you practical plans for acquiring the money which is yours. Hand over the thought suggested in the preceding paragraph to your imagination, and see what your imagination can, or will do, to create practical plans for the accumulation of money through transmutation of your desire. Do not wait for a definite plan, through which you intend to exchange services or merchandise in return for the money you are visualizing, but begin at once to see yourself in possession of the money, demanding and expecting meanwhile, that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan, or plans you need. Be on the alert for these plans, and when they appear, put them into action immediately. When the plans appear, they will probably “flash” into your mind through the sixth sense, in the form of an “inspiration.” This inspiration may be considered a direct “telegram,” or message from Infinite Intelligence. Treat it with respect, and act upon it as soon as you receive it. Failure to do this will be fatal to your success. — location: [1066](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1066) ^ref-45036

---
When visualizing the money you intend to accumulate, (with closed eyes), see yourself rendering the service, or delivering the merchandise you intend to give in return for this money. This is important! — location: [1085](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1085) ^ref-18913

After you have read the entire book, come back to this chapter, and follow in spirit, and in action, this instruction: Read the entire chapter aloud once every night, until you become thoroughly convinced that the principle of auto-suggestion is sound, that it will accomplish for you all that has been claimed for it. As you read, underscore with a pencil every sentence which impresses you favorably. — location: [1125](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1125) ^ref-11436

An educated man is not, necessarily, one who has an abundance of general or specialized knowledge. An educated man is one who has so developed the faculties of his mind that he may acquire anything he wants, or its equivalent, without violating the rights of others. Henry Ford comes well within the meaning of this definition. — location: [1142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1142) ^ref-9393

---
Finally, Mr. Ford became tired of this line of questioning, and in reply to a particularly offensive question, he leaned over, pointed his finger at the lawyer who had asked the question, and said, “If I should really want to answer the foolish question you have just asked, or any of the other questions you have been asking me, let me remind you that I have a row of electric push-buttons on my desk, and by pushing the right button, I can summon to my aid men who can answer any question I desire to ask concerning the business to which I am devoting most of my efforts. Now, will you kindly tell me, why I should clutter up my mind with general knowledge, for the purpose of being able to answer questions, when I have men around me who can supply any knowledge I require?” There certainly was good logic to that reply. That answer floored the lawyer. Every person in the courtroom realized it was the answer, not of an ignorant man, but of a man of education. Any man is educated who knows where to get knowledge when he needs it, and how to organize that knowledge into definite plans of action. Through the assistance of his “Master Mind” group, Henry Ford had at his command all the specialized knowledge he needed to enable him to become one of the wealthiest men in America. It was not essential that he have this knowledge in his own mind. Surely no person who has sufficient inclination and intelligence to read a book of this nature can possibly miss the significance of this illustration. — location: [1152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1152) ^ref-670

The accumulation of great fortunes calls for power, and power is acquired through highly organized and intelligently directed specialized knowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily, have to be in the possession of the man who accumulates the fortune. — location: [1168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1168) ^ref-28625

If you have imagination this chapter may present you with an idea sufficient to serve as the beginning of the riches you desire. Remember, the idea is the main thing.

Synthetic imagination:— Through this faculty, one may arrange old concepts, ideas, or plans into new combinations. This faculty creates nothing. It merely works with the material of experience, education, and observation with which it is fed. It is the faculty used most by the inventor, with the exception of the who draws upon the creative imagination, when he cannot solve his problem through synthetic imagination. Creative imagination:— Through the faculty of creative imagination, the finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence. It is the faculty through which “hunches” and “inspirations” are received. It is by this faculty that all basic, or new ideas are handed over to man. — location: [1377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1377) ^ref-19472

The creative faculty becomes more alert, more receptive to vibrations from the sources mentioned, in proportion to its development through Use. This statement is significant! Ponder over it before passing on. — location: [1386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1386) ^ref-32295

Read the entire book through, then come back to this chapter, and begin at once to put your imagination to work on the building of a plan, or plans, for the transformation of your desire into money. Detailed instructions for the building of plans have been given in almost every chapter. Carry out the instructions best suited to your needs, reduce your plan to writing, if you have not already done so. The moment you complete this, you will have definitely given concrete form to the intangible desire. Read the preceding sentence once more. Read it aloud, very slowly, and as you do so, remember that the moment you reduce the statement of your desire, and a plan for its realization, to writing, you have actually taken the first of a series of steps, which will enable you to convert the thought into its physical counterpart. — location: [1400](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1400) ^ref-58209

If you are one of those who believe that hard work and honesty, alone, will bring riches, perish the thought! It is not true! Riches, when they come in huge quantities, are never the result of hard work! Riches come, if they come at all, in response to definite demands, based upon the application of definite principles, and not by chance or luck. Generally speaking, an idea is an impulse of thought that impels action, by an appeal to the imagination. All master salesmen know that ideas can be sold where merchandise cannot. Ordinary salesmen do not know this—that is why they are “ordinary.” — location: [1526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1526) ^ref-5853

---
The story of practically every great fortune starts with the day when a creator of ideas and a seller of ideas got together and worked in harmony. Carnegie surrounded himself with men who could do all that he could not do. Men who created ideas, and men who put ideas into operation, and made himself and the others fabulously rich. — location: [1562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1562) ^ref-22576

Gradually, the idea became a giant under its own power, and it coaxed, nursed, and drove me. Ideas are like that. First you give life and action and guidance to ideas, then they take on power of their own and sweep aside all opposition. — location: [1574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1574) ^ref-29285

If the first plan which you adopt does not work successfully, replace it with a new plan, if this new plan fails to work, replace it, in turn with still another, and so on, until you find a plan which DOES WORK. Right here is the point at which the majority of men meet with failure, because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail. The most intelligent man living cannot succeed in accumulating money— nor in any other undertaking— without plans which are practical and workable. Just keep this fact in mind, and remember when your plans fail, that temporary defeat is not permanent failure. It may only mean that your plans have not been sound. Build other plans. Start all over again. — location: [1603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1603) ^ref-41249

13. Lack of a well defined power of decision. Men who succeed reach decisions promptly, and change them, if at all, very slowly. Men who fail, reach decisions, if at all, very slowly, and change them frequently, and quickly. Indecision and procrastination are twin brothers. Where one is found, the other may usually be found also. Kill off this pair before they completely “hog-tie” you to the treadmill of failure. — location: [1943](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=1943) ^ref-19317

Wrong selection of a vocation. No man can succeed in a line of endeavor which he does not like.

The majority of people who fail to accumulate money sufficient for their needs, are, generally, easily influenced by the “opinions” of others. They permit the newspapers and the “gossiping” neighbors to do their “thinking” for them. “Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by “opinions” when you reach decisions, you will not succeed in any undertaking, much less in that of transmuting Your own desire into money. — location: [2177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2177) ^ref-43531

Spasmodic, or occasional effort to apply the rules will be of no value to you. To get results, you must apply all of the rules until their application becomes a fixed habit with you.

Poverty is attracted to the one whose mind is favorable to it, as money is attracted to him whose mind has been deliberately prepared to attract it, and through the same laws. Poverty consciousness will voluntarily seize the mind which is not occupied with the money consciousness. A poverty consciousness develops without conscious application of habits favorable to it. The money consciousness must be created to order, unless one is born with such a consciousness. — location: [2379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2379) ^ref-11976

Like all states of mind, persistence is based upon definite causes, among them these:— a. Definiteness of purpose. Knowing what one wants is the first and, perhaps, the most important step toward the development of persistence. A strong motive forces one to surmount many difficulties. b. Desire. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire. c. Self-reliance. Belief in one’s ability to carry out a plan encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. (Self-reliance can be developed through the principle described in the chapter on auto-suggestion). d. Definiteness of plans. Organized plans, even though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage persistence. e. Accurate knowledge. Knowing that one’s plans are sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages persistence; “guessing” instead of “knowing” destroys persistence. f. Co-operation. Sympathy, understanding, and harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence. g. Will-Power. The habit of concentrating one’s thoughts upon the building of plans for the attainment of a definite purpose, leads to persistence. h. Habit. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by forced repetition of acts of courage. Everyone who has seen active service in war knows this. Before leaving the subject of persistence, take inventory of yourself, and determine in what particular, if any, you are lacking in this essential quality. Measure yourself courageously, point by point, and see how many of the eight factors of persistence you lack. The analysis may lead to discoveries that will give you a new grip on yourself. — location: [2435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2435) ^ref-53044

Riches do not respond to wishes. They respond only to definite plans, backed by definite desires, through constant persistence. — location: [2508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2508) ^ref-14706

There are four simple steps which lead to the habit of persistence. They call for no great amount of intelligence, no particular amount of education, and but little time or effort. The necessary steps are:— 1. A definite purpose backed by burning desire for its fulfillment. 2. A definite plan, expressed in continuous action. 3. A mind closed tightly against all negative and discouraging influences, including negative suggestions of relatives, friends and acquaintances. 4. A friendly alliance with one or more persons who will encourage one to follow through with both plan and purpose. — location: [2509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2509) ^ref-32247

As one makes an impartial study of the prophets, philosophers, “miracle” men, and religious leaders of the past, one is drawn to the inevitable conclusion that persistence, concentration of effort, and definiteness of purpose, were the major sources of their achievements. — location: [2573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2573) ^ref-36656

When ideas or concepts flash into one’s mind, through what is popularly called a “hunch,” they come from one or more of the following sources:— 1. Infinite Intelligence 2. One’s subconscious mind, wherein is stored every sense impression and thought impulse which ever reached the brain through any of the five senses 3. From the mind of some other person who has just released the thought, or picture of the idea or concept, through conscious thought, or 4. From the other person’s subconscious storehouse. — location: [2777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2777) ^ref-59642

One of America’s most successful and best known financiers followed the habit of closing his eyes for two or three minutes before making a decision. When asked why he did this, he replied, “With my eyes closed, I am able to draw upon a source of superior intelligence.” — location: [2803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2803) ^ref-36325

In his laboratory, he had what he called his “personal communication room.” It was practically sound proof, and so arranged that all light could be shut out. It was equipped with a small table, on which he kept a pad of writing paper. In front of the table, on the wall, was an electric pushbutton, which controlled the lights. When Dr. Gates desired to draw upon the forces available to him through his Creative Imagination, he would go into this room, seat himself at the table, shut off the lights, and concentrate upon the known factors of the invention on which he was working, remaining in that position until ideas began to “flash” into his mind in connection with the unknown factors of the invention. — location: [2808](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2808) ^ref-21950

The reasoning faculty is often faulty, because it is largely guided by one’s accumulated experience. Not all knowledge, which one accumulates through “experience,” is accurate. Ideas received through the creative faculty are much more reliable, for the reason that they come from sources more reliable than any which are available to the reasoning faculty of the mind. — location: [2819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2819) ^ref-9979

For example, the scientific inventor, or “genius, begins an invention by organizing and combining the known ideas, or principles accumulated through experience, through the synthetic faculty (the reasoning faculty). If he finds this accumulated knowledge to be insufficient for the completion of his invention, he then draws upon the sources of knowledge available to him through his creative faculty. The method by which he does this varies with the individual, but this is the sum and substance of his procedure: 1. He stimulates his mind so that it vibrates on a higher-than-average plane, using one or more of the ten mind stimulants or some other stimulant of his choice. 2. He concentrates upon the known factors (the finished part) of his invention, and creates in his mind a perfect picture of unknown factors (the unfinished part), of his invention. He holds this picture in mind until it has been taken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of all thought, and waits for his answer to “flash” into his mind. — location: [2825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2825) ^ref-56331

The pages of history are filled with the records of great leaders whose achievements may be traced directly to the influence of women who aroused the creative faculties of their minds, through the stimulation of sex desire. — location: [2840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2840) ^ref-23259

Nature has prepared her own potions with which men may safely stimulate their minds so they vibrate on a plane that enables them to tune in to fine and rare thoughts which come from— no man knows where! No satisfactory substitute for Nature’s stimulants has ever been found. — location: [2891](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2891) ^ref-51955

reason. The most powerful of all human emotions is that of sex. There are other mind stimulants, some of which have been listed, but no one of them, nor all of them combined, can equal the driving power of sex. — location: [2897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2897) ^ref-63362

The salesman who knows how to take his mind off the subject of sex, and direct it in sales effort with as much enthusiasm and determination as he would apply to its original purpose, has acquired the art of sex transmutation, whether he knows it or not. The majority of salesmen who transmute their sex energy do so without being in the least aware of what they are doing, or how they are doing it. — location: [2918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2918) ^ref-60788

Every intelligent person knows that stimulation in excess, through alcoholic drink and narcotics, is a form of intemperance which destroys the vital organs of the body, including the brain. Not every person knows, however, that over indulgence in sex expression may become a habit as destructive and as detrimental to creative effort as narcotics or liquor. — location: [2939](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H4J1KPY&location=2939) ^ref-35873
