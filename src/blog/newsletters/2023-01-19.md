## Personal update:

It's been a busy and productive week over here:
* Finishing up the <a href='https://dvassallo.gumroad.com/l/small-bets' target='_blank'>Small Bets Course</a> this week with Cohort 21.
* Started the <a href='https://fscourses.com/p/decision-by-design-sign-up-now' target='_blank'>Decision by Design</a> 12-week course.
* Got the website up for <a href='https://macmartine.com/' target='_blank'>The Curious Innovator</a>.
* Went to a detective agency here in Zagreb to have our fingerprints taken and sent to the FBI for background checks needed to apply for the Portugal Digital Nomad Visa.
