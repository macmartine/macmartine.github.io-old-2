Another famous example is actor Jim Carrey, who wrote himself a check in 1987 in the amount of 10 million dollars.

Here’s a brief summary of how I use Visualization, followed by three simple steps for you to create your own Visualization process. After I’ve read my affirmations, I sit upright on my living room couch, close my eyes, and take a few slow, deep breaths. For the next five minutes, I simply visualize myself living my ideal day, performing all of my tasks with ease, confidence, and enjoyment. For example, during the months that I spent writing this book (okay, who am I kidding—it took years), I would first visualize myself writing with ease, enjoying the creative process, free from stress, fear, and writer’s block. I also visualized the end result—people reading the finished book, loving it and telling their friends about it. Visualizing the process being enjoyable, free from stress and fear, motivated me to take action and overcome procrastination. — location: [1723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AKKS278&location=1723) ^ref-62747

Visualize your major goals, deepest desires, and most exciting, would-totally-change-my-life-if-I-achieved-them dreams. See, feel, hear, touch, taste, and smell every detail of your vision. — location: [1754](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AKKS278&location=1754) ^ref-23502

---
Now, fast forward into the future to see yourself achieving your ideal outcomes and results. You can either look towards the near future—the end of the day—or further into the future, like I did while writing this book, when I visualized people reading it, loving it, and recommending it to their friends. The point is you want to see yourself accomplishing what you set out to accomplish, and you want to experience how good it will feel to have followed through and achieved your goals. — location: [1758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AKKS278&location=1758) ^ref-48658

Vision Boards were made popular by the bestselling book and film The Secret. A Vision Board is simply a poster board on which you post images of what you want to have, who you want to become, what you want to do, where you want to live, etc. Creating a Vision Board is a fun activity you can do on your own, with a friend, your significant other, or even your kids. — location: [1785](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AKKS278&location=1785) ^ref-63405
