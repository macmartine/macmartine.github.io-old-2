<p>People we might ordinarily dislike—unsavory or unwelcome sales operators, disagreeable acquaintances, representatives of strange or unpopular organizations—can greatly increase the chance that we will do what they wish merely by providing us with a small favor prior to their requests. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002BD2UUC&amp;location=424">424</a> ^ref-36277</p>

<p>In most instances, a small amount of the relevant product is provided to potential customers for the stated purpose of allowing them to try it to see if they like it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002BD2UUC&amp;location=489">489</a> ^ref-63829</p>

<p>Of course, by now you and I know that the customer who has accepted and used the BUG products has been trapped into facing the influence of the reciprocity rule. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002BD2UUC&amp;location=508">508</a> ^ref-9948</p>

<p>Another person can trigger a feeling of indebtedness by doing us an uninvited favor. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002BD2UUC&amp;location=538">538</a> ^ref-3642</p>

<p>Once again, we can turn to the Regan experiment for evidence. Remember in that study that Joe gave one group of subjects a bottle of Coca-Cola as an initiating gift and later asked all subjects to buy some of his raffle tickets at twenty-five cents apiece. What I have so far neglected to mention is that the study was done in the late 1960s, when the price of a Coke was a dime. The average subject who had been given a ten-cent drink bought two of Joe’s raffle tickets, although some bought as many as seven. Even if we look just at the average subject, though, we can tell that Joe made quite a deal. A 500 percent return on investment is respectable indeed! — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002BD2UUC&amp;location=600">600</a> ^ref-1571</p>

<p>As we have seen, there was such a concession: I changed from noncompliant to compliant when he changed from a larger to a smaller request, even though I was not really interested in either of the things he offered. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002BD2UUC&amp;location=653">653</a> ^ref-8919</p>

<p>I had been moved to buy something not because of any favorable feelings toward the item, but because the purchase request had been presented in a way that drew force from the reciprocity rule. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002BD2UUC&amp;location=656">656</a> ^ref-20352</p>

<p>The technique is a simple one that we can call the rejection-then-retreat technique. Suppose you want me to agree to a certain request. One way to increase your chances would be first to make a larger request of me, one that I will most likely turn down. Then, after I have refused, you would make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along. Provided that you have structured your requests skillfully, I should view your second request as a concession to me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of my own, the only one I would have immediately open to me—compliance with your second request. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002BD2UUC&amp;location=673">673</a> ^ref-61305</p>

<p>The truly gifted negotiator, then, is one whose initial position is exaggerated enough to allow for a series of reciprocal concessions that will yield a desirable final offer from the opponent, yet is not so outlandish as to be seen as illegitimate from the start. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002BD2UUC&amp;location=713">713</a> ^ref-25747</p>
