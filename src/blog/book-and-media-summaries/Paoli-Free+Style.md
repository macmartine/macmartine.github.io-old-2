## Highlights
When observing and describing how our bodies move, we should start at the spine and move out toward the extremities, or start from the global level and move to the local level. As discussed previously, starting at the global level focuses us on the overall shape of the body based on the midline. Starting this way is also key for creating safe and effective progressions, or methods for learning movement. Progressions are one of the most important parts of this book and will be described in detail in chapter 3. — location: [684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09PLLH6GD&location=684) ^ref-12477

Flow is being able to perform the shift of your center of mass in relation to your base of support while changing points of contact with the surfaces around you in a fluid manner. — location: [848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09PLLH6GD&location=848) ^ref-43229

The goal is always to chase the best way, not the most familiar way. Maintaining this relationship between functionality and health helps you map out the optimal way to do something. — location: [932](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09PLLH6GD&location=932) ^ref-33406

Exercise has always been a part of our lives, but the fitness field didn’t become important until the human population developed into a formalized society in which the physical requirements of day-to-day living were vastly diminished. — location: [983](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09PLLH6GD&location=983) ^ref-23331

Movement control can be thought of as a two-sided system: one side is the central nervous system (CNS), or brain and spinal cord, and the other is the peripheral nervous system (PNS), or the projections that innervate all muscle tissue. — location: [1059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09PLLH6GD&location=1059) ^ref-41271

This simplified understanding of the nervous system as a two-sided system with a rod that balances the CNS need for stability and the PNS need for mobility allows us to approach and challenge movement control through basic shapes. — location: [1069](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09PLLH6GD&location=1069) ^ref-43452
