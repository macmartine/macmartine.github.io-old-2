<p>waning. Research shows that concentration can last for only an average of twenty minutes while reading, so you might want to take a quick break, about five minutes, every twenty to thirty minutes.

I call it reading actively, fair and square. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00M9P6JVS&amp;location=1213">1213</a> ^ref-1090</p>
