<p>Narcissists can also inhabit positions that are seemingly charitable and philanthropic. They can be in both helping professions (social workers or pastors at the church for example) as well as professions that are ideal for the narcissist to execute his or her power. Now, there are wonderful, validating and helpful counselors out there, but there are also counselors who abuse their power, just like in any other profession where power is granted. There are mental health professionals who have NPD and masquerade as caring, empathic people to gain supply from their clients. Unfortunately, abuse by a therapist is not uncommon, and it is likely that these professionals themselves suffer from NPD or ASPD. They misuse their power and abuse what is meant to be a validating, therapeutic alliance to provoke, taunt and manipulate the victim according to their agenda. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01B01O3PA&amp;location=828">828</a> ^ref-22752</p>

<p>They may appear remorseful or cry crocodile tears, but often it is when there is no other course of action to take to escape accountability for their actions. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01B01O3PA&amp;location=854">854</a> ^ref-64616</p>

<p>How do narcissists get away with such shapeshifting? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01B01O3PA&amp;location=887">887</a> ^ref-3031</p>

<p>Narcissists do not choose us because we are like them; they choose us because we are the light to their darkness; — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01B01O3PA&amp;location=921">921</a> ^ref-25699</p>

<p>All narcissists, sociopaths and psychopaths are emotionally unavailable, but not all emotionally unavailable people are narcissists, sociopaths and psychopaths. The difference lies in their intention to harm, their inability to change and their sadistic nature. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01B01O3PA&amp;location=1088">1088</a> ^ref-55158</p>

<p>It is also not a matter that can be &quot;worked&quot; out, as narcissists are not willing to change because their manipulative behavior rewards them. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01B01O3PA&amp;location=1093">1093</a> ^ref-32305</p>

<p>If on the other hand, if you feel this partner had the ability to empathize but simply did not want a close relationship, it could be emotional unavailability. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01B01O3PA&amp;location=1096">1096</a> ^ref-61531</p>

<p>Since NPD is a personality disorder, others may wonder why we are holding these types of abusers accountable for their abuse. After all, why should someone be held accountable for their illness? I believe it is counterproductive to compare NPD to mental illnesses like schizophrenia, as many self-professed narcissists such as Sam Vaknin and sociopaths do admit to enjoying the damage they do to others and feeling a sense of control/power when they do inflict that damage. These are two different conditions that should not be compared. Narcissists and sociopaths are aware of their actions and the impact of their actions – we know this not only from the voices of narcissists and sociopaths themselves but also in the way they smear their victims and the various methods they use to escape accountability such as gaslighting and projection. You cannot plot to blame someone else for your actions if you are not aware of your own blame and are attempting to escape exposure. You also cannot switch your mask rapidly from the true self to the false self when there is a witness if your behavior is not under your conscious control. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01B01O3PA&amp;location=1149">1149</a> ^ref-52876</p>
