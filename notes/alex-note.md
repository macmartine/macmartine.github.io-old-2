The background jobs are running to keep data up to date, though I'm still monitoring them and tweaking them as will be til we get them dialed. Let's monitor the see if data seems to come in fast enough. I'm erring on not overdoing it.

* Do a pass on styling / pretty things up.
* Fix chrome extension error
* Update/submit Chrome extension
* Add progress bar in onboarding

Before you leave it would be super useful if we could at least start the discussion from $100 offers about who we 'could' target, and all their problems. That will really help me prioritize what to do while you're gone. There are a lot of little things we can do, and features we can add, and I really want to make sure we make smart decisions here and really focus on the high-value stuff.

Side-note: Over the last couple weeks I've been thinking a lot about how I think I can be effective when it comes to marketing. I actually did a quick write-up here that might be insightful for you in knowing what I've been thinking about: https://macmartine.com/blog/posts/2022-01-09/ 

I also just launched a newsletter, the goal being to start building an audience - not specific to LI, but definitely some overlap. It'll be another place for me to promote the tool. Trying to prepare to hit this from a lot of angles.
