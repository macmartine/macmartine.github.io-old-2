Beware when you are seeking out information that confirms your existing beliefs, or when you dismiss information that opposes your current thinking. 

The more we are convince that something is true, the more we latch onto information that confirms that believe, and the quicker we dismiss anything that is at odds with it. This can be a dangerous path to take. Pay attention to when you dimiss information or interpret something as true too quickly, it will often be the confirmation bias at work, which gravitates towards reinforcing your existing bias's.
