<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>In the process of pursuing my own deeper motives, the ego neuroses that once preoccupied me, my obsessions with sexuality, achievement, love, and dependency, haven’t all gone away. What has gone is my preoccupation and my identification with them. Now they are merely quaint and fascinating, an interesting room or passing show rather than the huge mountains and crevasses and devastating potential disasters which once seemed to surround me on every side. Though I may get angry, I let go of the anger more quickly. And more important, I let go of the guilt connected with the anger. These feelings now simply arise and pass away, without my resisting or clinging to them. More and more I am just awareness. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=271">271</a> ^ref-15327</p>

<p>As you advance in meditation, these external motives fall away. You begin to feel a spiritual pull from within. It is profound and it is scary. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=324">324</a> ^ref-2365</p>

<p>Normal waking consciousness, dream states, emotional states, and other states of consciousness are different realities, somewhat like channels of the TV receiver. As you walk down the street you can tune your “receiver” into the world on any number of channels. Each way of tuning creates a very different street. But the street doesn’t change. You do. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=394">394</a> ^ref-16146</p>

<p>As you progress you become less excited about collecting the melodrama of the daily news; for as you delve within yourself, you want less and less to feed your mind unnecessary images and thoughts that agitate it. You simplify what you talk about, what you watch, and what you read. You find yourself drawn to new kinds of books, perhaps books written by those who speak from the quiet of meditation. They are invaluable in creating a space in which your mind can become quiet also. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=504">504</a> ^ref-3356</p>

<p>If you meditate regularly, even when you don’t feel like it, you will make great gains, for it will allow you to see how your thoughts impose limits on you. Your resistances to meditation are your mental prisons in miniature. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=572">572</a> ^ref-18410</p>

<p>By gently but firmly trying to keep your attention focused on the candle flame, you begin to see your thoughts and senses grabbing at your awareness. You become aware of the process of attachment. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=678">678</a> ^ref-48280</p>

<p>This training in one-pointedness of mind is the first step in learning not to cling. The goal of meditation is to free your awareness from its identification with your senses and thoughts. So freed, your awareness permeates everything but clings to nothing. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=680">680</a> ^ref-8644</p>

<p>When you finally develop the capacity to meditate from the moment of awakening to the moment of sleep, and yet stay perfectly at ease in the world, moment to moment living becomes a totally delightful and freeing experience. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=1249">1249</a> ^ref-34771</p>

<p>A persistent trap all along the path is pride in one’s spiritual purity. It’s a form of one-upmanship in which you judge others out of a feeling of superiority. This ultimately limits your spiritual awakening. You can see many people who are caught in this trap of virtue—for example, in the self-righteousness of some churchgoers. In the yoga scene in America there are many groups of people who dress in a certain way, eat in a certain way, are special in some way that gives them an ego-enhancing feeling of purity. The harmful effect of this trap is not so much to one’s social relationships—though they may become strained from this display of subtle arrogance—but rather the effect on oneself. This feeling of specialness or superiority inflates the ego and feeds it with pride. The best antidote to pride is humility, which leads to compassion. The sooner one develops compassion in this journey, the better. Compassion lets us appreciate that each individual is doing what he or she must do, and that there is no reason to judge another person or oneself. Merely to do what you can to further your own awakening. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=2045">2045</a> ^ref-46538</p>

<p>As I look around at people I know who have been working intensely on themselves for some time, there is a dramatic change. I see beings who were initially preoccupied with their melodramas, whose bodies were their enemies and who were attached to spiritual melodrama, now bright, clear, and strong. Their lives have come together, they have relationships that are fulfilling, moments that are enough, a lightness in their faces. To see them this way fills me with happiness. Yet I see that this stage is but a preparation for the ultimate climb that leads in the end to total liberation. This stage has a danger: It is too comfortable. It’s like a beautiful mountain pasture: there are tents in the pine grove and streams to sit by and plenty of fuel and food. The air is clear, the view is grand. There are birds and wildflowers. These pleasures are a trap. Many beings tarry here in this role of God on earth for many lifetimes. But ultimately even this heaven is not enough. For there is another path that leads from this pleasant pasture to still higher slopes. There is the final journey. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=2113">2113</a> ^ref-26051</p>

<p>The body constantly tries to draw attention to itself by its shiverings, its breathlessness, its palpitations, its shudders and sweats and cramps; but it reacts quickly to any scorn and indifference in its master. Once it senses that he is not taken in by its jeremiads, once it understands that it will inspire no pity that way, then it comes into line and obediently accomplishes its task. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=2190">2190</a> ^ref-47739</p>

<p>The way that will relieve your woes on the physical plane will also take you to the highest spiritual realizations. And the way is simple. No resistance. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=2200">2200</a> ^ref-27301</p>

<p>The path to freedom is through detachment from your old habits of ego. Slowly you will arrive at a new and more profound integration of your experiences in a more evolved structure of the universe. That is, you will flow beyond the boundaries of your ego until ultimately you merge into the universe. At that point you have gone beyond ego. Until then you must break through old structures, develop broader structures, break through those, and develop still broader structures. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=2215">2215</a> ^ref-9365</p>

<p>By letting go of whatever thoughts may come, no matter how powerful or fascinating they may be, and constantly returning to the meditation, our mental habits lose their hold over us. We create space for new possibilities, new realities, new being. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=2265">2265</a> ^ref-12828</p>

<p>It is not that you must be free from fear. The moment you try to free yourself from fear, you create a resistance against fear. Resistance, in any form, does not end fear. What is needed, rather than running away or controlling or suppressing or any other resistance, is understanding fear; that means, watch it, learn about it, come directly into contact with it. We are to learn about fear, not how to escape from it, not how to resist it through courage and so on. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=2355">2355</a> ^ref-29418</p>

<p>Meditation brings this change. Each moment starts to have a richness or thickness of its own. Fewer moments are special as more of them become richer. This lessens the rushes, the highs and lows. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=2374">2374</a> ^ref-31054</p>

<p>The art of meditation, however, is to work gradually with these new energies to free awareness from ego without destroying it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006L7R2EI&amp;location=2492">2492</a> ^ref-63725</p>
