Finding the Lead Domino

All decisions lie on the following matrix:

[Image needed]

Spend time on the decisions that are irreversible an inconsequential.

This quadrant is where the "lead dominos" lie - those decisions that will create a more positive future and create less problems going forward. Ignoring these decisions, or making poor choices here, can result in a future where more time is spent cleaning up messes. This helps us avoid having countless obstacles in our way that we could have avoided.

## How to I handle these big, overwhelming decisions?

When faced with life-changing decisions, there are several tactics we can use to ensure we make the best choice we can:

- Slow down
- Gather information
- Try things out
- Think long term

## What do I do with all other types of decisions

Decisions that do not fall into the consequential and irreversible quadrant can usually be handle by:

- Delegating them
- Ignoring them
- Deciding quickly with intuition.

By definition, the outcomes of these decisions are not life-changing and you can change your mind in the future without a big loss.
