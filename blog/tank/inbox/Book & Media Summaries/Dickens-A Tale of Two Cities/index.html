<p>France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07MW9KTHY&amp;location=23">23</a> ^ref-23994</p>

<p>In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07MW9KTHY&amp;location=33">33</a> ^ref-40511</p>

<p>“But this is my father’s story, sir; and I begin to think”—the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him—“that when I was left an orphan through my mother’s surviving my father only two years, it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07MW9KTHY&amp;location=399">399</a> ^ref-9223</p>

<p>“As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;—then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07MW9KTHY&amp;location=419">419</a> ^ref-51311</p>

<p>“But he has been—been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best. Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07MW9KTHY&amp;location=453">453</a> ^ref-38326</p>

<p>“If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste, and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07MW9KTHY&amp;location=865">865</a> ^ref-52138</p>

<p>it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07MW9KTHY&amp;location=1200">1200</a> ^ref-5526</p>
