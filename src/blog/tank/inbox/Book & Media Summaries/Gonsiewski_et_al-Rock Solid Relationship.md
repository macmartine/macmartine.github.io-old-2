## Highlights
A companion is a partner whose qualities and opinions complement, not necessarily match, your own. — location: [116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=116) ^ref-16056

---
And, being with someone who has different traits gives us a chance to improve ourselves and to grow new interests and skills. — location: [130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=130) ^ref-62533

---
How does that growth happen? It happens when we accept the challenge to learn how to engage in conflict in a manner that doesn't leave either of us feeling wrong or less than equal. — location: [131](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=131) ^ref-65214

In essence, in your relationship, as the infatuation phase naturally waned, you both lost your “magic powers” to make the other feel like a million bucks. You also lost your tolerance for all those small imperfections and started to see your partner's flaws in Technicolor. In fact, you picked up a magnifying glass and exaggerated your partner's shortcomings! You probably did not examine your own diminished treatment of your partner, because humans always pay more attention to how someone is hurting them rather than examining their own behavior. — location: [183](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=183) ^ref-12793

---
When you stopped prioritizing your relationship, you stopped contributing all the necessary ingredients for lasting love: patience, tolerance, acceptance, affection, compassion, interest, affirmation, playfulness, sexual prowess, and humor. You eventually began to associate time spent with your partner with disappointment and pain. — location: [191](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=191) ^ref-53794

---
But, when the relationship becomes an afterthought and is put on the back burner, tension and stress arises. The disconnection can cause a slippery slope to conflict and lead to resentment, disappointment, and discouragement. You become less and less available and present with one another. Instead of talking out a conflict, you act it out. You come home and plop down in front of a screen and barely say “hi” to your partner. You find more and more that needs to get done at work. You want your girls' or guys' night out, instead of date night with your honey. You spend hours on Facebook instead of talking and cuddling. The kids' needs are more important than your relationship needs. Think of these as avoidance behaviors. You are consciously or unconsciously avoiding the conflict you are convinced will arise, while, in the meantime, you are creating good reasons for future upsets! — location: [197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=197) ^ref-54830

How do you make this “conscious” effort? It's a two-step process: 1) Set the intention of raising your relationship's importance to the top, and 2) Initiate daily loving behaviors. — location: [233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=233) ^ref-50637

One way you can return your partner to priority status is by spending more time with him or her. — location: [251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=251) ^ref-34482

---
Unfortunately, a popular relationship myth claims that, to be happy in a relationship, you need to be happy with yourself first—and that requires spending a lot of time doing things alone or with friends and family other than your partner. Our experience tells us the opposite is true: Instead, happy couples make for happy individuals! — location: [252](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=252) ^ref-28811

---
Your relationship is the foundation upon which the rest of your life is built, so it always needs to come first. When your marriage is happy, everything else in your life is better. — location: [285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=285) ^ref-56490

---
Even turning the TV off and talking to each other a few nights a week may seem strained. What do you talk about? We suggest you start by picking a topic of interest to you both. Or consider preparing a meal together and catching up on the news of your day. A quiet walk in the evening also can do wonders for a relationship that has felt distant. — location: [287](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=287) ^ref-2145

---
When you are bickering about who is right, you stop treating one another as lovers and friends. You have to remember that love is a verb and discipline yourself to practice actions of love. What nature once did for you, you must do now on your own if you intend to make love last. — location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=312) ^ref-47908

---
The trouble lies ahead when we are naïve to the fact that we must take deliberate actions in order to continue what nature so generously started. — location: [341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=341) ^ref-36007

---
Learning what our partner needs and overcoming our own obstacles to giving and receiving takes work. It requires us to learn how to love our partner. When we make the decision to do this and follow it with actions and behaviors that meet our partner's needs, that's when we find real love. And when we experience real love, we make our relationship rock solid. — location: [361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=361) ^ref-715

---
Our attempt to give our partner love is often based on our own ideas of what love is rather than on our partner's ideas. — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=365) ^ref-52931

---
Ask your partner what feels loving, and, when he/she responds, listen and take notes. For example, you might inquire, “Please tell me 10 things I can do or have done to make you feel loved.” — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=380) ^ref-20212

---
After each of you has the list of what each enjoys as loving behaviors, resolve to do one or two daily. Then, in a month, compare how each of you is doing. With more experience, you and your partner can adjust your lists and become experts at expressing real love. This will move you a long way toward a rock solid relationship. — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=386) ^ref-42270

---
In fact, the joyous responsibility of a committed relationship is that you will show your love actively at least a few times a day. — location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=393) ^ref-48498

---
Small actions are the daily loving behaviors such as the welcome home kiss, a sweet text in the middle of the day, bringing your partner a cup of coffee, and an appreciation spoken earnestly. Medium actions take more planning and effort. These would include date nights, a surprise gift, making love, buying tickets to a concert, or setting aside time for fun. Large actions require advanced planning, lots of discussion, and perhaps saving money. Examples are weekends spent away, an overnight hike, vacations without the kids, and major adventures. — location: [395](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=395) ^ref-61864

---
The actions of love can be grouped into several categories: Accepting Your Partner Tenderness and Affection Affirmation, Appreciations, and Encouragement Acts of Responsibility Acts of Giving Couple Time Keeping Romance Alive Sex — location: [399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=399) ^ref-19810

---
In general, accepting your partner involves acknowledging that he/she is an individual with his/her way of seeing and doing things, that he/she is just as OK as you are, and that his/her ideas are not inferior to your own. To accept your partner is to allow his/her point of view to prevail—at least half the time—without a fuss or anxiety that his/her way will not be good enough. — location: [408](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=408) ^ref-51214

---
As noted earlier, being accepted by your partner is a wonderful expression of love. When you acknowledge that your partner's way of thinking, feeling, and acting is as good as your own, your partner can relax and be open and passionate in return. When you seek your partner's opinion and let that opinion prevail half the time, you are showing you accept his or her intelligence, wisdom, and creativity. Imagine how loved your partner will feel when you are willing to make ample space for his or her full self in your relationship! — location: [422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=422) ^ref-60640

---
In addition to accepting your partner—in all his or her quirky, complicated, interesting, odd wonder—being affectionate and tender also can be instrumental in bringing the two of you closer and in fortifying your relationship. — location: [427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=427) ^ref-26301

---
In fact, research indicates that one 10-second hug a day can lead to hormonal reactions in your body that can significantly improve your health. — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=435) ^ref-20105

---
Every day without fail, give your partner at least two gestures of affection and tenderness. — location: [448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=448) ^ref-5495

---
Do you tell your partner at least once per day you think he or she is terrific? Do you let him or her know how valuable he or she is to you—and why? Verbal appreciations are a means of “catching your partner doing the right thing” and are vital to healthy relationships. — location: [451](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=451) ^ref-46192

---
Consider the value of adding daily verbal expressions of appreciation and encouragement. Think how much happier the environment between the two of you could be if you spoke up daily and said, “Thanks for unloading the dishwasher.” “Wow, you are the best cook in the world.” “I love you more than anyone or anything.” “You can do that marathon. I know you can. I want to be there along the way cheering you on.” “You smell great.” “You are the most handsome man in the world.” See where we are going with this? You are the representative of adult love for your partner. He or she looks to you for approval all the time, both consciously and unconsciously. Too much disapproval can kill a relationship. It makes us feel unworthy. Everyone needs validation, cheerleading, and expressions of respect in order to feel our best. — location: [458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=458) ^ref-28965

---
Your partner unconsciously looks to you for acceptance. You are the one who should be noticing your partner's beauty and strength. You are the one who sees his or her struggles and should offer encouragement. You are also the one who reaps the benefits of the actions taken by your partner to support your lifestyle. So speak up! Affirm, appreciate, and encourage. Eventually, verbal expressions of love will become second nature. — location: [468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=468) ^ref-34102

---
With a lot to be done, a strong couple must define and share responsibilities—and thank each other for being responsible. — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=474) ^ref-592

---
Responsible actions are only a loving gesture if they are done willingly and without nagging. Make a list of every responsibility in your marriage you can define. Go beyond the obvious housework and laundry. Include things such as ordering and stacking firewood, cleaning the gutters, buying school clothes and birthday gifts, taking the kids to dentist appointments, etc. Share your lists and talk about how often the activities must be done and who usually does them. Do you like the tasks and responsibilities you have? Does the current way of doing things work for both of you? Do both of you feel the breakdown of responsibility is equal in the ways that you each want it to be equal? — location: [475](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=475) ^ref-58676

---
Once you divide up the tasks in a manner that seems fair to you both, you need to agree on when the tasks should be done and how often. — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=485) ^ref-7762

---
To minimize conflict, consider any strong preferences when you divide up the responsibilities. In dividing them, do what actually works for you two. — location: [489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=489) ^ref-34415

---
If your partner doesn't notice your action, don't take it personally. It could be for lots of reasons. It is not uncommon throughout a long marriage to miss some of your partner's kindnesses. We do take one another for granted, and we need to become more conscious and develop better habits of paying attention. If you ever find yourself in the situation of an act of kindness or responsibility going unnoticed, instead of being hurt, just sweetly point out the kindness: “Hey, did you notice your clean car?” There is nothing wrong with drawing attention to your action. After all, you are learning to work together as a team, showing and accepting love. — location: [501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=501) ^ref-61574

When gifts are given, it is crucial you receive them well. — location: [517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=517) ^ref-54797

---
As noted in the last chapter, spending time together makes a significant “deposit in the relationship savings account.” Some examples of things to do during your time together include just talking, going on a date, having an adventure, playing a game, doing a project, occasionally watching a show, relaxing in the hot tub, taking a walk, cuddling, or maybe even making love. — location: [525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=525) ^ref-46333

---
At least once a day you need couple time. Even 20 minutes together interacting will strengthen your connection. — location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=533) ^ref-57615

---
Turn off televisions and computers and go to bed at the same time at least three nights per week. Have a weekly date night. Set aside weekly times to play a game or go for a walk. You get the point! Your relationship must be your number one priority if you want your love to last. — location: [534](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=534) ^ref-59264

---
An important part of couple time needs to be talking to each other. In our offices we have noted what many studies have found that one in four couples speak to their partner for less than 10 minutes a day (O'Connor, 2005). If you and your partner are in that statistic, no good can come of it. That level of disconnection will weaken your marriage. Studies have also shown that couples who average over 30 minutes per day talking with each other have a significantly higher rate of happiness — location: [536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=536) ^ref-18547

---
And, please, no sitting in the living room ignoring the living, breathing spouse beside you while you take the time to update your social media site! Otherwise, you soon may be changing your Facebook status to single. — location: [539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=539) ^ref-21184

---
Talking is foreplay for a very important loving action: sex. The more we share our thoughts, feelings, experiences, dreams, hopes, and fears, the closer we feel. The closer we feel, the more we want to touch one another. Talking is the gateway to sex. Open the gate. — location: [545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=545) ^ref-8639

---
Although no relationship can sustain the infatuation phase for more than a matter of months, you can keep romance alive for a lifetime. And you must if you want your relationship to be rock solid. — location: [551](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=551) ^ref-29758

---
Both men and women have romantic expectations. If you don't continue the regular efforts necessary to meet those expectations, you and your partner will be disappointed. Also, consider this, no one else can meet your partner's romantic expectations. At least you do not want them to be met by others. You and your partner are the sole source for romance and for sex (but more on that later). If you do not make adequate efforts toward romance, you both will feel romantic deprivation. — location: [553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=553) ^ref-64668

---
Couples who continue to date once per week over the course of their marriage are three times more likely to report feeling happy in their marriages than those couples who have stopped having a date night — location: [561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=561) ^ref-44897

---
Research has always shown that couples who have regular dates have the highest sexual frequency and are less likely to divorce — location: [567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=567) ^ref-41289

---
Going on a double date can reignite passion in your relationship even better than a candlelit dinner for two. — location: [568](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=568) ^ref-63056

---
Time spent with another couple sharing thoughts and experiences puts your spouse in a new light. You learn things from his or her disclosures, as well as see what a funny, sensitive, and likable person he or she can be. — location: [570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=570) ^ref-64035

---
An amazing effect of the infatuation phase is that you were attracted to and became involved with someone who has the missing skills you didn't develop. Likewise, your partner chose you because you have his or her missing skills. Once infatuation turns into a committed relationship, you and your partner have the unique and important opportunity to grow and master all the skills that will bring you both joy and fulfillment—but only if you choose to work at it. — location: [611](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=611) ^ref-46521

---
Let's say you grew up in a family where there was little physical affection. If giving physical affection is not a skill you witnessed or developed growing up, chances are that affection will be the loving action your partner desires most, and he or she may become frustrated if you're not providing it. Committed relationship provides the opportunity to develop our full adult capabilities. If you married someone who never challenges you in your areas of arrested development, you will never grow. — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=616) ^ref-5724

---
When we learn a new loving skill, we not only make our partner feel loved, but we also become more confident, complete, and fulfilled. With consistent effort, you can learn to give your partner the treatment that spells L-O-V-E to him or her. — location: [623](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=623) ^ref-8875

---
Here's an exercise you can do to develop your loving skills: Ask your partner what he or she would like to see more of from you. Choose one doable loving action and commit aloud to doing it consistently. Check in with your partner on a weekly basis for a month, asking how your efforts are going. Share your own view of this as well, and be sure to include any difficulties you encountered. If modifications are needed, commit to taking new action. — location: [625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=625) ^ref-2400

---
Practicing asking for what you need and giving your partner what he or she asks for develops a new habit. This new habit will work on your unconscious processes, and you will begin to feel more deserving. Perhaps it will feel uncomfortable or awkward, but every new habit feels that way at first. — location: [642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=642) ^ref-1497

---
Learning to navigate your relationship without manipulation will build respect, equality, and appreciation. You can overcome feeling manipulated and being manipulative with the help of effective communication skills and a little effort. — location: [661](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=661) ^ref-6995

---
You can live your day-to-day life in a standoff, holding out on your partner until he or she “goes first.” What that will lead to will be either long-term misery or divorce. The other alternative is to take the high road and reach out first. Once the ball is rolling again between the two of you, does it really matter who started? Do you want to be right—or do you want a happy and loving relationship? — location: [671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=671) ^ref-51209

---
The wiring and wounding of early relationships leaves us each with a unique tolerance for how much closeness we can tolerate. When a partner becomes too close, we feel uncomfortable. After all, he or she may disapprove of us, start a conflict, or boss us around. To manage the discomfort, our brain begins to notice how our partner is different than us. We then unconsciously label the differences as negative, and we judge and criticize in order to justify stepping back and not being as close. It sounds crazy, but it's not. It's human nature. However, treating your partner with love is difficult if you are frequently thinking harsh thoughts. — location: [684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=684) ^ref-2737

---
For one minute, close your eyes and picture your partner at his or her most appealing. Maybe you see him in a shirt that makes his eyes shine. Maybe she's asleep. Or awake. Laughing. Paying attention to you. Making love. Whatever image holds positive feelings for you. Spend just one minute and do this three times a day. In this process, you will rewire your brain for automatic loving thoughts of your partner. You also will increase your hardwired ability to tolerate closeness. — location: [690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=690) ^ref-6568

---
If you do catch yourself making negative judgments, stop the thought and replace it with three positive statements. If you thought, “He's never on time,” replace it with, “He is such a good dad.” Over time, you will see an improvement in your mood, and you will find it effortless to give positive energy to your partner. — location: [693](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=693) ^ref-44475

Find a way to talk about your sexual needs and physical pleasure. What do you desire? What would increase your interest? Do you have any fantasies the two of you could act out that would fan the flame? What do you want to hear or see that would spark interest? Talking about this frankly will not obligate you to anything. Instead, it will increase trust, and as a couple you can decide what suits the two of you. — location: [1848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=1848) ^ref-59084

That is, for many women, desire is not the trigger for lovemaking but, rather, its result. In yet other words, women often begin sexual experiences feeling sexually neutral, but, once they engage in sensual activities—such as kissing, cuddling, and caressing—then they likely begin to feel desire as the encounter progresses. — location: [1867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ZXYHKTW&location=1867) ^ref-7525
