## Highlights
out. It was like starting to write a novel. When I face the desolate impossibility of writing five hundred pages a sick sense of failure falls on me and I know I can never do it. This happens every time. Then gradually I write one page and then another. One day’s work is all I can permit myself to contemplate and I eliminate the possibility of ever finishing. — location: [595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B001BC6GN6&location=595) ^ref-5797
