The effect of our personal experiences and beliefs on our ability to make decisions. Good at explaining why we made mistakes in the past but doesn't help us from making mistakes in the future. Even knowing about them doesn't help. Source of cognitive biases: meta-bias. It's hard to see a system we are part of. 

Example: Ball on train. If on train, ball not moving, if watching train go by, ball moving at 60mph.

What to do: Take yourself out of the equation, walk around the problem through different lenses.

## Finding the Lead Domino

All decisions lie on the following matrix:

![[Pasted image 20230123183717.png]]

Focus on decisions in the top-right quadrant - consequential and irreversible.

Spend time on the decisions that are irreversible an inconsequential.

This quadrant is where the "lead dominos" lie - those decisions that will create a more positive future and create less problems going forward. Ignoring these decisions, or making poor choices here, can result in a future where more time is spent cleaning up messes. This helps us avoid having countless obstacles in our way that we could have avoided.

### How to I handle these big, overwhelming decisions?

When faced with life-changing decisions, there are several tactics we can use to ensure we make the best choice we can:

- Slow down
- Gather information
- Try things out
- Think long term

### What do I do with all other types of decisions

Decisions that do not fall into the consequential and irreversible quadrant can usually be handle by:

- Delegating them
- Ignoring them
- Deciding quickly with intuition.

By definition, the outcomes of these decisions are not life-changing and you can change your mind in the future without a big loss.

## The Root Problem

Jumping to a solution before we know the right problem is how we put out fires, not prevent them

The first problem we encounter is often not the right problem. This is why we shouldn't jump to solutions without considering if the problem has been defined properly.

How we state the problem dictates the solutions we see.

Top performers are often impatient b/c them jump into solution mode. 

2 ways to increase the odds we're solving the right problem.

1) Never accept someone else's definition of the problem.
2) Put of a firewall btw the problem definition and problem solution discussions. 2 separate meetings (when team-based).

Slow down, delay.

If personal (no team), articulate the problem in words or writing - make it concrete.

My takeaway here: In the context of fixing bugs, choose the correct solution, the one that will create less problems and easier decisions in the future.

Ask yourself:
- What would have to be true for this problem not to exist in the first place?
- Is this the symptom or the problem?
- Is this the root problem, or a secondary problem that the root problem has created?
- Will solving this particular problem pass the test of time?

At a high level, a decision involves:
- Solving a problem
- Preventing a future problem
- Capitalizing on an opportunity

Problem statement:
- What we want
- Where we want to go
- What's getting in the way of being there

So:
1) Get to the root problem
2) Ensure solution is addressing the cause of the problem, not a symptom of it

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure

It's easier to avoid problems than solve them

A lot of our time is spent correcting initial mistakes

---

Don't reward heroic fire-fighting. They should have prevented it in the first place. The root problem is that that problem shouldn't have occurred in the first place.

---

By separating the problem from the solution, you're giving yourself time to think, to process, to make connections, to see the big picture, to let your subconcious brain kick in. Getting yourself out of the short time-bursts of energy used to make decisions. Delaying intuition, and will as a result, make better decisions.

Real-world examples:

What problem, if addressed, would get Alex paying me on time?
- Demand letter, in time.
	- Does stand the test of time, at least as much as is possible, I think

What problem, if addressed,  would solve my Portugal salary issue?
- Dropping salary to $3300/mo would extend runway
- Or, get more money in the business account (but I believe it needs to be earned - can't pay out more than we make, can we?)

## When to Decide

### How to know when we've gathered enough information and it's time to decide.

If we act too soon we may miss out on crucial information.
If we act too late, we miss out on opportunity.

The more consequential, the longer we want to wait.

Use same matrix from [Decision Making](src/blog/atoms/indexes/20230213100544.md)

As soon as possible vs. as late as possible. We don't want to spin out.
aka: ASAP vs ALATE

How to know when it's time time act:
Stop, FLOP, or know:
- You've stopped gathering information
- You first loose an opportunity (FLOP)
- You've gathered a critical piece of information that helps you decide

Signs that you've gathered enough information:

1) STOP:
Studies by Paul Slovak and Daniel Kahmenann (horse race prediction test), x show that acquiring more information has diminishing returns.

Useful information capped out at 17%, even though their confidence level went way up with further information.

<!--
After a certain point additional information only feeds [Confirmation Bias](20230213104057.md)
-->

Related: 80/20 rule in that ~20% of the information will get you 80% of the way to the best decision you'll be able to make

2) FLOP

Red flag for when you have to decide is when you're starting to lose opportunity.

3) KNOW

A decision that makes it obvious as to how to decide.

### How to Preserve optionality while gathering information

Invert the situation and avoid the worst possible outcome

You may not know the route to the best possible outcome, but you can likely eliminate the worst possible outcome.
Get clear on the worst case scenario and do what you can to avoid it.

Shoot bullets before cannonballs:
Don't be overly invested in a single option.
Keep future options open by taking small low-risk steps towards as many options as possible.

Live with the decision before you announce it. Let the draft email sit...

Sleep on all major decisions before telling anyone. We start to see the information in a new light. And we can check in with our emotional selves.

Don't be afraid to look short-term-stupid if you need to hold out til you have the right decision.

If you have to make a decision, make the smallest one possible while you gather more information.

#### Bonus -- off the cuff - The Illusion of Knowledge

The worst time to look for information is when you actually need it.

We overvalue easily accessible information, and become more confident than we should be.

Collect raw, rich sources of data.

## The Most Important Thing

If you don't know where you want to go, any road will get you there."

It's easy to say what you don't want. It's more important to know what you do want. What's the most important thing?

Get clear on your values and objectives. Don't be the bottleneck.

List your objectives.

Compare them, and see which one's matter more, as some may conflict.

Introduce quantities to objectives. Maybe you don't want to manage a real estate investment, but what is the threshold? 1 hour per week?

Make your objectives battle for priority.

## Owning the frame

Get out of the binary decision box and see if you can create another option.

When given binary choices, the outcome is often not ideal. When given a third choice, the chance of outcome skyrockets.

One of the biggest mistakes of decision-makers is letting other people frame the decision, and limit the options.

Techniques:
1) Vanishing options: What would you do if one of the options was gone?
Given that option, what might it look like? What could you do, if that choice were made, to still get closer to your objectives? Then flip the situation, and figure out what you'd do?

2) This and that options: Can you combine solutions?
If your partner isn't always meeting your needs, you may feel like you need to either stay or go: binary. What about asking yourself if there's someone else in your life that can meet the unmet needs, while staying in your relationship?

3) Opportunity costs: We are good as seeing what we will gain in a given scenario but terrible at seeing what we will lose.

4) Gather more information: If you have an inclination as to what choice to make, ask yourself what information would change your mind. If you don't have an inclination, ask what information would help you decide.

#### Bonus - Off the cuff - Seeking out disconfirming information

Automatic behaviors: A good one is to seek out evidence contrary to your argument. Is there data that says your argument is not true?

When something surprises you, it's worth looking into what's going on. It means the world isn't working in the way you expect it to - the way the model in your head says it should. What is it you need to update in your view?
