When I sold my business 18 months ago, I saw what types of things made a sale go smoothly. While I don't think a founder should spend an inordinate amount of time and energy trying to get everything perfectly right, there are some easy things to do that will make things easier, should you be fortunate enough to sell the business.

Here's the short list:

- Use a separate bank account for all business expenses.

- Use a separate account for any online services, such as domains, as it makes it easier to see business costs, and it makes transfering them much easier.

- While it's tempting to justify extra expenses as write-offs, lower expenses look better in a valuation. Even though a buyer should in theory be able to see what expenses are optional, it's cleaner to be able to show a clear high profit margin.

- Always have any contractors, or anyone that does any work for your business, sign off on the IP. You need to be able to make it super clear that nobody else has any rights to your IP.

- Keep all your logins in its own 1Password vault, or similar, so you can quickly and easily disclose and transfer online accounts.
