<p>If I’m lazy or haphazard in my actions during the first hour after I wake up, I tend to have a fairly lazy and unfocused day. But if I strive to make that first hour optimally productive, the rest of the day tends to follow suit.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=637">637</a> ^ref-10375</p>

<p>Always remember that where you are is a result of who you were, but where you go depends entirely on who you choose to be, from this moment on. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=883">883</a> ^ref-15613</p>

<p>To defeat this cause of mediocrity, you need a life purpose, which can be any purpose you want. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=912">912</a> ^ref-55916</p>

<p>However, when you actively design and write out your affirmations to be in alignment with what you want to accomplish and who you need to be to accomplish it—and commit to repeating them daily (ideally out loud)—they immediately make an impression on your subconscious mind. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=1560">1560</a> ^ref-21837</p>

<p>My first first-hand experience using affirmations came when I read about them in Napoleon Hill’s legendary book, Think and Grow Rich (which I highly recommend, by the way). — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=1576">1576</a> ^ref-34154</p>

<p>Here Won’t Get You There by Marshal Goldsmith. It reads, “The #1 skill of influencers is the sincere effort to make a person feel that he or she is the most important person in the world. It’s one of the skills that Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, and Bruce Goodman used to become the best in their fields. I will do this for every person I connect with!” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=1659">1659</a> ^ref-33638</p>

<p>Another famous example is actor Jim Carrey, who wrote himself a check in 1987 in the amount of 10 million dollars. He dated it for “Thanksgiving 1995” and added in the memo line, “For acting services rendered.”  He then visualized it for years, and in 1994 he was paid 10 million dollars for his starring role in Dumb and Dumber. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=1716">1716</a> ^ref-29747</p>

<p>Here’s a brief summary of how I use Visualization, followed by three simple steps for you to create your own Visualization process. After I’ve read my affirmations, I sit upright on my living room couch, close my eyes, and take a few slow, deep breaths. For the next five minutes, I simply visualize myself living my ideal day, performing all of my tasks with ease, confidence, and enjoyment. For example, during the months that I spent writing this book (okay, who am I kidding—it took years), I would first visualize myself writing with ease, enjoying the creative process, free from stress, fear, and writer’s block. I also visualized the end result—people reading the finished book, loving it and telling their friends about it. Visualizing the process being enjoyable, free from stress and fear, motivated me to take action and overcome procrastination. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=1723">1723</a> ^ref-62747</p>

<p>Visualize your major goals, deepest desires, and most exciting, would-totally-change-my-life-if-I-achieved-them dreams. See, feel, hear, touch, taste, and smell every detail of your vision. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=1754">1754</a> ^ref-23502</p>

<p>Now, fast forward into the future to see yourself achieving your ideal outcomes and results. You can either look towards the near future—the end of the day—or further into the future, like I did while writing this book, when I visualized people reading it, loving it, and recommending it to their friends. The point is you want to see yourself accomplishing what you set out to accomplish, and you want to experience how good it will feel to have followed through and achieved your goals. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=1758">1758</a> ^ref-48658</p>

<p>Vision Boards were made popular by the bestselling book and film The Secret. A Vision Board is simply a poster board on which you post images of what you want to have, who you want to become, what you want to do, where you want to live, etc. Creating a Vision Board is a fun activity you can do on your own, with a friend, your significant other, or even your kids. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00AKKS278&amp;location=1785">1785</a> ^ref-63405</p>
