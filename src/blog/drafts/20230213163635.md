Advertising and paid media is generally highly over-valued. It may create a small spike but it's preferable to have sustained momentum. The most value that publicity on big networks or publications is in the form of credibility more than sales. Being on 20/20 may or may not produce a boost in sales, but it will definitely create credibility. It's also notable that even if you're only on there for a moment, or the performance is poor, or response is negative, the level of credibility isn't much affected.

While this type of publicity can be welcome, often-times energy is better spent on more sustainable marketing techniques that will generate more consistent momentum.
