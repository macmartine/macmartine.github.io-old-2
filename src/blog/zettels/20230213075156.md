Social media can be good for getting your thoughts out there, being vulnerable. Sharing your ideas. It can be great for creating relationships. When you find yourself engaging or doing things with followers in mind, you're wasting your time. Followers verily, follow you elsewhere when Twitter dies. But relationships will.

Social media followers will not necessarily follow you, but relationships will.
