<p>The fastest way to market with a product idea is: Registera.com. Get hosting from dathorn.com [a cheap reseller account, like www.domainsinseconds.com]. With two clicks set up a wordpress blog. Apply a theme to it. Add your content and a buy now button. The buy now button links to an enter e-mail address, phone number, etc., page. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=3299">3299</a> ^ref-58391</p>

<p>Henry Ford once said, referring to his Model-T, the bestselling car of all time,56 “The customer can have any color he wants, so long as it’s black.” He understood something that businesspeople seem to have forgotten: Serving the customer (“customer service”) is not becoming a personal concierge and catering to their every whim and want. Customer service is providing an excellent product at an acceptable price and solving legitimate problems (lost packages, replacements, refunds, etc.) in the fastest manner possible. That’s it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=3491">3491</a> ^ref-7803</p>

<p>The more options you offer the customer, the more indecision you create and the fewer orders you receive—it is a disservice all around. Furthermore, the more options you offer the customer, the more manufacturing and customer service burden you create for yourself. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=3495">3495</a> ^ref-45235</p>

<p>So what I have found success in doing is: (1) Finding a niche group that would buy my muse, (2) sending a message to each admin telling them how my muse will help their group members. Then politely asking them to put a blurb in the “Recent News” section of the group. This makes it more trustworthy than a wall post, and it stays up there (free advertising) until the admin removes it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=3735">3735</a> ^ref-55218</p>
