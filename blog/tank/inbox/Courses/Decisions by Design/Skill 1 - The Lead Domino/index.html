<p>Focus on decisions in the top-right quadrant - consequential and irreversible.</p>
<p>If decision is inconsequential or irreversible we can change our minds easily. Little impact on life.</p>
<pre><code>**Lead Dominoes:**
</code></pre>
<p>Consequential and irreversible decisions are those that change the trajectory of our life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who we marry</li>
<li>If we have kids</li>
<li>Where we live</li>
<li>Which house of business to buy</li>
<li>Career</li>
</ul>
<p>Type 1 decisions: Lead Dominoes
Type 2 decisions: All other quadrants</p>
<p>Type 2 decisions can often be delegated</p>
<p>The fewer the consequences, the lower down in the organization the decision can be delegated</p>
<p>Break is down into smaller decisions - those will generally fall in other quadrants.
Gather information, ask other, give things a trial run.</p>
