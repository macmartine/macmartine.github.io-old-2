As it goes with most creators, I have built a lot of apps, and most don't go anywhere, but every-so-often something gets a little traction. For this reason, these days I generally try to make many small bets, instead of going all in on a big bet. Here's the list of apps/products I can remember, and I periodically am reminded of more, and I add them here when I do.
