<p>Light weight: less than two pounds. This way, you’ll pay less in shipping costs. Small enough to fit in a shoebox. Again, this saves on shipping costs and Amazon fees. Best Seller Rank (BSR) of 6,000 or less The Best Seller Rank (BSR) gives you a rough idea of how well that product is selling. For example, if you see a BSR of 1, that means that’s the top-selling product in — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=166">166</a> ^ref-34672</p>
<hr>
<p>Depending on the category, you want the best-ranked version of the product you’re considering to have a BSR of 6,000 or less. Even with a rank as high as 10,000, you may still sell 10 or 15 units a day – maybe even 20 – so don’t let a higher BSR number scare you. A lot of people try to go after something that’s in the top 100 or the top 500, but that’s going to be more competitive. You may be better off in the 500 to 6,000 range for your first product. Competing products with 500 reviews or less The fewer reviews your competitors have, the easier it will be for you to get a similar number for your product. When shoppers see a lot of positive reviews on a product, it helps them trust your product enough to buy it. Imperfect listings on competing products If your competitors have few or bad pictures, their listings are not optimized for search, or the other listings just don’t look very professional, that will make it easier for you to win customers for your product. All of these metrics feed into the goal of launching a — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=170">170</a> ^ref-23384</p>

<p>In this example, the title is pretty good. They’ve got “acrylic compact organizer” and “beauty care holder” in the title. Those are both keywords. (Even though “acrylic compact organizer” is three words, it’s considered a keyword – something people are searching for.) The keywords are important because when people are looking for something to buy, you want to match what they search for. One way to do that is to include the important keywords in your title. The images are also every important. They’re a big driver for getting people to click on your listing. These images are nice, but I think the seller could do a better job. For a makeup related listing, I think they should use an image of a girl’s face. I think that would get more people to look at it. As you look at a listing, think about it this way, looking for things you could improve upon. You also want to look at whether the item is fulfilled by the merchant or by Amazon. In this case, it’s fulfilled by Amazon (FBA). But if you found one that’s fulfilled by merchant, that means that the vendor is going to fulfill it, not Amazon. That’s an advantage for you because if you fulfill it by Amazon, I believe that Amazon will give you a little bit of a push. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=200">200</a> ^ref-47707</p>
<hr>
<p>You want to make it as obvious as possible to Amazon that your product is relevant to customers who want to buy this product. You do that by including keywords in the bullet points. You definitely want to use all five bullet points available to you – don’t waste them. Looking at this example, these are decent. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=214">214</a> ^ref-55283</p>

<p>This is the information I need to see how competitive the market is and whether there’s enough demand that I can expect to make 10 sales a day or more. I’ll also come back in a week and check these numbers again to see if they’ve changed. Sometimes a competitor will be running a promotion, and that will inflate the BSR on that product. If I come back in a week and everything is about the same, I give a lot more credibility to these numbers. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=226">226</a> ^ref-42309</p>
<hr>
<p>Before you choose a product, I want you to repeat this process for 10 to 20 products. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=235">235</a> ^ref-21287</p>
<hr>
<p>Before you search, you’ll also want to check these filters: Trade Assurance and Gold Supplier. Trade Assurance means that this supplier has insurance to protect you. If you order a product and you’re not happy with it, you can get a refund up to a certain amount. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=263">263</a> ^ref-23213</p>
<hr>
<p>The Gold Supplier designation means that they’ve been verified by Alibaba as a legitimate business. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=265">265</a> ^ref-58014</p>

<p>Hi, My name is ————– and I’m the purchasing agent for XYZ Company. We are in the process of adding a ——————— to our product line and your product seems to be what we are looking for. I have a few questions. 1. Do you offer samples and how much would they cost including DHL Express Shipping to United States zip code 89078?  2. How long to receive 2 samples?  4. Can we change the color?  5. Can we brand with our logo?  6. What is the cost per unit including shipping by DHL — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=277">277</a> ^ref-10205</p>
<hr>
<p>Air Express to United States Zip Code 89076?  7. How long for manufacturing once we place an order?  8. Do you accept Escrow payments? Our first order of 500 will be a small test order, and in the future we will be ordering 1,000 to 5,000 units. Can we order 500 units for the first order? We are looking forward to hearing from you soon. Thank You!

<p>As you contact suppliers, the person who writes back is often an agent. I didn’t realize this at first, but the great thing about talking with an agent is that they can help you, not just with this product, but with future products as well. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=306">306</a> ^ref-21549</p>
<hr>
<p>For now, all you need is simple packaging and an insert card with your branding. The packaging could be as simple as a plastic bag or pouch. The insert card should be a nice, heavy cardstock with some glossy print and your logo on it, and maybe a quick-start guide on the back. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=317">317</a> ^ref-23134</p>
<hr>
<p>You’ll also need to buy a UPC code for this product. A lot of different companies sell UPC codes, and you can buy them cheap. You don’t need the sticker, just the number. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=319">319</a> ^ref-30277</p>
<hr>
<p>When you set up your listing, Amazon will assign you an FNSKU. You may want to print your FNSKU on your packaging instead of your UPC. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=326">326</a> ^ref-32129</p>
<hr>
<p>Once you’ve settled on your packaging and the insert, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=331">331</a> ^ref-13672</p>
<hr>
<p>you’re ready to place your order. For your first order, I recommend ordering at least 500 units if you can. This way, you can use 100 units for promotions, which will jumpstart sales from the beginning. But if you can’t afford that many at first, don’t let that stop you. As I mentioned earlier, Tayson Whittaker started with just one unit. Chris Gastin, who did the $500 challenge, started with 50. You can succeed with a smaller starting order; it just might take a little longer. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=332">332</a> ^ref-33009</p>
<hr>
<p>For shipping, I recommend shipping by air and having the first order delivered to you, not directly to Amazon. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=335">335</a> ^ref-37494</p>
<hr>
<p>To Do: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=346">346</a> ^ref-44562</p>
<hr>
<p>Building a Launch List — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=353">353</a> ^ref-47182</p>
<hr>
<p>If you choose this option, remember to create the page with a focus on the market, not the product itself. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=355">355</a> ^ref-40071</p>
<hr>
<p>Once you create the page, you’ll use Facebook ads to gain fans. I would run ads that said, “I love to cook,” or “Cooking is my life. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=357">357</a> ^ref-59403</p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s the key. Using this option, you need to publish daily content. But that’s easier than it sounds because you can get that content from other popular fan pages. All you have to do is find the posts that have gotten a lot of likes and been shared a lot, and then re-share them on your page. You can usually do four to five posts a day this way. It’s not hard, and it doesn’t take a lot of time. You can also ask questions: What’s your favorite dish? What’s your favorite way to cook this? You can even schedule posts in advance so that you don’t have to be on Facebook five times a day. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=360">360</a> ^ref-2020</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s the whole goal here: to build up this little group of fans so that when you’re ready to give away your product to get reviews, you already have fans who want to receive it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=366">366</a> ^ref-15261</p>
<hr>
<p>Now you can target those 3,000 people for $5 a day with a Facebook ad. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=370">370</a> ^ref-50785</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s also another option besides using a Facebook fan page, and that’s building an email list. It’s — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=375">375</a> ^ref-58419</p>
<hr>
<p>To do this, you need to create a special offer page with a coupon. Then you’ll run Facebook ads to this offer. For example, your ad might say “Receive this garlic press for $2.95 while supplies last.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=378">378</a> ^ref-49728</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s more effective to get people on your email list than to try to get sales from a Facebook ad. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=396">396</a> ^ref-46773</p>
<hr>
<p>Next, you want to create the five bullet points that will appear at the top of your listing. It’s important to stress the product’s benefits here. You also want to describe what the product does. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=407">407</a> ^ref-44870</p>
<hr>
<p>Think about your target audience and why they would buy your product instead of buying from your competitor. Use your bullet points to convey that as clearly and persuasively as possible to your target audience. What’s important to them? What features or benefits do they care about most? That’s what you want to focus on. Once you have your bullet points, you can use a lot of the same information in the description. You’ll want to include the details and benefits, plus a call to action. For example, you could say, “Click the button above to order your garlic press.” The description isn’t — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=408">408</a> ^ref-17117</p>
<hr>
<p>You also want to make sure that the image is at least 1,500 pixels by 1,500 pixels because then when a user rolls the mouse over your image, Amazon will pop up a zoomed-in version of the area where the mouse is. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=429">429</a> ^ref-50026</p>
<hr>
<p>If you see a listing with only one bullet point, that represents a great opportunity for you to come in and outrank that product. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=438">438</a> ^ref-46295</p>
<hr>
<p>But for your description, the most important part is to have all of the keywords so that Amazon realizes your product is relevant to those keywords. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=441">441</a> ^ref-33660</p>
<hr>
<p>To Do: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=448">448</a> ^ref-44562</p>
<hr>
<p>But what determines your product’s rank? Part of this comes from the keywords in your listing, but the most important factor is how many people search for that keyword and then buy your product. If someone searches for “garlic press” and then buys yours, that’s proof to Amazon that your product is a good match for people who want to buy a garlic press, so Amazon will rank your product higher for that search term. The better your product ranks, the more people can find it, and the more you’ll sell. Another thing that impacts sales is reviews. People may find your product based on keywords, but they buy based on other people’s recommendations – in other words, reviews. And how do you get more reviews? More sales. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=460">460</a> ^ref-29504</p>
<hr>
<p>You can also use other people’s lists to get more reviews. For example, I use Tomoson.com. Tomoson can connect you with bloggers who want to review physical products. In return for receiving the product, these people review it on their blog and also post a review on Amazon. That gives you a double benefit: the link from their blog pointing to your listing, which might give you some additional traffic, and a review on Amazon. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=475">475</a> ^ref-22733</p>
<hr>
<p>Now it’s time to make use of your email list or Facebook page. This is where you’re going to let your fans know that you have these products that you want to give away to the first 10 people. You’ll give these people a coupon code, and when they buy your product using that code, Amazon applies a discount. These first few sales are not at full price, but they still count as sales. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=485">485</a> ^ref-8297</p>
<hr>
<p>When you do this, you’re also going to say that you want an honest review. That’s why you’re giving these products away for $1.99 or $4.99, or even for free. You trigger sales, and you get reviews to help you make more sales. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=487">487</a> ^ref-53406</p>
<hr>
<p>For your launch, you should plan to give away 50 to 100 units in total. I like to discount to $1.95 for these giveaway units. That’s low enough that it’s a no-brainer – anyone who wants your product will jump on it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=489">489</a> ^ref-64492</p>
<hr>
<p>When you set this up, I recommend spreading the giveaways out over a few days. If I’m giving away 100 units, I like to make it 20 sales a day for five days. That way, I establish a steady pattern of sales over time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=491">491</a> ^ref-47416</p>
<hr>
<p>Another tip I want to give you is to use a follow-up system for feedback and reviews. Feedback is not the same thing as reviews. Feedback goes on your seller account and says how you did as a seller. On the other hand, reviews are about the product itself, not you as the seller. Feedback and reviews both help you, so let’s talk about how to get them. I currently use Salesbacker, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=495">495</a> ^ref-59969</p>
<hr>
<p>To Do: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=513">513</a> ^ref-44562</p>
<hr>
<p>Set up a pay-per-click ad in your Seller Central account. (You’ll need a professional account to do this.) Choose automatic targeting. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=536">536</a> ^ref-898</p>
<hr>
<p>Run the ad campaign for seven days, then pause it and run a report. The advertising system is often way behind the rest of Amazon, so the numbers you’ll see before the ad has been running for seven days are probably way off. That’s why I recommend letting it run for seven days, then pausing it and getting a report. Look through the report and find out what keywords Amazon targeted for your product. This report shows you the keywords Amazon used and the statistics for them. For each keyword, you can see how many times the ad was displayed (the number of impressions), how many people clicked on it, and how many sales you got from the ads. Use the data from step 4 to create a new campaign using the good keywords – the ones that have gotten sales or at least a lot of clicks. For this campaign, I recommend the same type of budget: at least $25 for the daily limit. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=545">545</a> ^ref-19616</p>
<hr>
<p>When you’re setting up your advertising and deciding how much to spend, there are different ways to think about it. In the beginning, you just want to get sales. Even if you only break even on the ads, it’s still going to be worth it because you’re going to start ranking for these keywords, which will give you more sales over time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=556">556</a> ^ref-23920</p>
<hr>
<p>So right now, I want you to forget about everything else except sales and reviews. In this phase, everything is up, everything is running, and everything is optimized. Focus on getting the most you can out of it. That means that, for the time being, I don’t want you to worry about Facebook ads, Google Adwords, Bing, building a website, blogging, YouTube videos, article marketing, social media channels, press releases, or any other tactics and strategies you may have heard of. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=566">566</a> ^ref-20852</p>

<hr>
<p>In my observation, here are some of the most common reasons why people fail in building this business: Choosing the wrong product Struggling to find the right supplier and getting stuck Failing to build a list and launch properly Creating poorly optimized listings Struggling to rank for keywords Wasting money on ineffective promotions Failing to use Amazon pay-per-click ads appropriately Having a “set it and forget it” mindset instead of testing and tweaking Overcomplicating the process — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=586">586</a> ^ref-62498</p>
<hr>
<p>I know feedback and reviews are important, so I went ahead and set up Feedback Genius for my email follow up, and opted for the FREE plan of 100 emails per month. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=608">608</a> ^ref-20329</p>
<hr>
<p>Give yourself a $500 budget. Find a product that is selling on Amazon, and try to source it from AliExpress for $200-$250. This should include shipping from China, prepping it for FBA, and sending to FBA. I opted for the cheapest shipping from China which was $25 total or $0.50 per unit. It took a little longer, but I was doing this on a budget. You will need the remaining $250-$300 for PPC. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=630">630</a> ^ref-883</p>

<hr>
<p>One thing I asked myself was if this does not work, can I move it at a break even cost? What is your cost for 1 unit? Supplier per unit cost + shipping to you + cost to prep for FBA + cost to send to FBA + FBA fees + any other cost you might have for that unit. Can you sell it for that and break even where you don't lose money? Or don't lose much money? If you can, then just pull the trigger and do it. You will only learn what works and does not work. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=732">732</a> ^ref-23115</p>
<hr>
<p>One tool that can give you more information is Jungle Scout. This tool uses the ranking data to estimate a product’s sales numbers. For example, Jungle Scout might say a product sold $25,000 last month, or 1,500 units. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=741">741</a> ^ref-45897</p>
<hr>
<p>In the beginning, I like to price low on purpose just to get some early sales. Then I’ll slowly raise the price. I think by doing that, you get more sales naturally. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=772">772</a> ^ref-11584</p>
<hr>
<p>Another thing to consider is that it’s easier to raise your price than it is to lower it, especially if you’re selling something like a consumable supplement – fish oil, for instance. If people buy at one price and then you drop the price, some people will get mad and return the item. Nobody gets mad if you raise the price after they bought it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=784">784</a> ^ref-30878</p>
<hr>
<p>You can also ask your supplier what other options they can make. They may have other standard things they can do to make it look different. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=791">791</a> ^ref-36617</p>
<hr>
<p>One great way to get ideas is to look through all of the reviews of competitors, even the ones that aren’t for the exact same product. Look at what people are saying, especially in the negative reviews, and listen to what their complaints are. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B017ROWWMK&amp;location=794">794</a> ^ref-37750</p>
