You can realistically expect that it will take you about three to six months to start seeing a profit. — location: [168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=168) ^ref-3817

Easy to Source – This means high quality items that you can find many suppliers for.  If you find a great product, but no suppliers, then you’ve wasted your time.  Or If you find a great product but very few suppliers for it, then you are at the mercy of whatever your supplier charges you.  You want to find products that you can find multiple suppliers for so that you can negotiate the best rates for your product.  Later on in this book, I’m going to show you exactly how to do this. — location: [257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=257) ^ref-60439

---
The more emotional component the product has, the more of an impulse buy the customer will make.   And of course, this also gives you the  ability to charge higher prices because people, when they’re emotional, tend to make decisions based on what’s going to make them feel good.  And hey, if that means splurging, they’ll do it as well, which is better for you. — location: [266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=266) ^ref-61503

Because it’s better to be a big fish in a small pond than to be a small fish in a big pond. — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=278) ^ref-47125

---
There is no better place to identify hot products than on the Amazon Best Seller List. — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=288) ^ref-455

---
Then move on the next main category on the list (I’ll usually go 3 – 4 categories deep). — location: [309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=309) ^ref-18722

---
In other words, find products that make great gifts for the holidays. — location: [329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=329) ^ref-47988

---
In order to find a USP for my product, the first thing I like to do is to pick a particular feature of the product to work with.  I start with a list of all of the different features and attributes of the product, and then I choose one specific feature that my competitors are not focusing on, that will be valuable to my customer.  Then I turn that one unique feature into my unique selling proposition. — location: [360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=360) ^ref-1655

---
You can make your features unique by asking your manufacturer to create a special design modification.  Or you can make an agreement with your supplier to exclusively sell their product on Amazon.  You can also add a special accessory, or a special design that your competitors cannot copy.   The idea is that by choosing a scarce USP, you are creating a competitive advantage in the marketplace that competitors cannot copy.  Also, the more unique and scarce it is, the more valuable it will be for your customer. — location: [368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=368) ^ref-23417

---
When you hear a lot of people complaining about the same things, make a list of these complaints, and choose one of them to make your unique selling proposition. — location: [377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=377) ^ref-7185

---
Another great place to find a great USP, is look at the specifications of your product, also known as “the product specs.”  Focus on a specific attribute you think will be very valuable in the eyes of your customer, and that other competitors are not focusing on.  Or choose a feature that can be used in another capacity, that no one has thought about yet. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=380) ^ref-26002

---
For example, I found a bestselling item in the bake ware category called Silicone Baking Cups.  What I found out when reading the reviews, is that many customers were using these silicone baking cup liners as Bento Lunch Box Liners.  This is a great example of a product that was sold for one reason, but could be used for another.  So, instead of selling these silicone liners for baking I would sell them as a Bento Lunch Box Liner, and simply call them “Bento Buddy Silicone Bento Lunch Box Liners.” — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=383) ^ref-44318

Vacuform plastic works too because it maintains the shape of the particular product so you can just neatly put the product in there. — location: [456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=456) ^ref-24161

---
If you provide anything extra with your product, it generally enhances your customer’s experience and therefore the value of your product.   The type of extras I mean are any type of accessories or bonuses that your customer can get with your product. — location: [461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=461) ^ref-6318

---
Bonuses also create a better experience for your customers.  By adding a free E-book download with the purchase of your product, it may be what pushes your risk averse customer into finally making the decision to buy. You can deliver that bonus in the form of a  little card that you put in with your product packaging. The card will direct them to your website, where they download their free E-book and join your email list. — location: [468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=468) ^ref-37208

---
Its main sites Taobao, Tmall, Aliexpress and Alibaba.com have hundreds of millions of users, and host millions of merchants and businesses. — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=502) ^ref-42587

---
But why go to AliExpress when you are dealing with the same wholesalers as Alibaba?  The reason I go to AliExpress is that you get good feedback information from customers that have previously purchased retail items from these suppliers.  This gives you even more data as to the quality of the supplier’s products. — location: [513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=513) ^ref-65204

---
Here are the questions I generally email suppliers when I am inquiring about their product: 1. What is the price per piece for bulk orders? 2. Do you have the ​product available? 3. How long will it take to have it ready to ship? 4. What is the minimum order quantity?​ 5. What is the shipping cost for the minimum amount? 6. What are your pricing tiers and quantity discounts?​ 7. Can you send me the label or package design template? 8. Can you add our logo to the unit? 9. What is the price and shipping cost for a sample? — location: [517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=517) ^ref-63574

If the sample doesn’t meet your criteria, you can always sell it on EBay and recoup some of your money back. — location: [576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=576) ^ref-31718

---
One way to negotiate a better price is to order a higher amount of products, and ask for a discount.  Another way is to search around for your supplier’s competitors to find better pricing, and use this information as a basis for bargaining for a better price from the supplier you want to do business with.  Last, you can convince your supplier to give you better pricing by establishing a paying relationship with them for a period of time, and asking them later to drop pricing because of your good paying history. — location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=584) ^ref-14596

---
Generally, you have two options when it comes to pricing.  You can price your product based on what everybody else is pricing, or, even better, you can create enough value with your unique brand that you can charge the highest prices. This is especially true on Amazon. People go to Amazon to spend more money.  They do not mind spending extra money on products because they know that it’s coming from Amazon; and they know they will have a great experience.  Because of this, on Amazon, if you create a valuable and unique brand with a lot of benefits, your customers will be willing to pay a lot more.  So, from a practical standpoint, a good goal for your pricing is to aim for getting an 100 percent return on investment, or more, after all your expenses. — location: [636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=636) ^ref-57017

---
Pricing for Momentum Pricing for Momentum means to price as low as possible in the beginning in order to immediately start making sales.  After you generate enough sales momentum, then you increase the price until you identify the ideal target price that will bring you the most daily sales and most profit. This is by far the most successful strategy in pricing in the Amazon Marketplace.  It is successful because it is based on the principle that customers have an ideal target price where a multitude of them will buy.  The ideal target price is the price that gives you the ideal profit you need, and motivates the most customers possible to purchase your product because it makes sense to them. — location: [672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=672) ^ref-63463

---
For the best results, its best to run these promotions on weekends, where the most people are on Amazon looking for something to spend their money on. — location: [681](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=681) ^ref-58758

---
Also with lower prices, you tend to attract more price sensitive customers.  Price customers, tend to be more demanding, they tend to complain more, and they’ll end up returning your product and giving you a negative review.  So if you price on the lower end, you tend to attract more of these people and there is not much you can do about it.  So, sometimes you have to be careful if you’re going to be on the lower end of the price spectrum. — location: [689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=689) ^ref-27488

---
Consider running weekly or monthly promotions to kick-start the momentum again in case it starts slowing down or to just to keep up the momentum.  Weekends and evenings are great because that’s when people are at home and that’s when they make a lot of purchases.  The second or third week of the month tends to be good for promotions too, because this is after customers have paid all their bills and they have some extra time and money to spend. — location: [709](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=709) ^ref-55686

enough.  If you want people to buy, you need to fill it up with six to eight high quality pictures. Another important key to motivating customers through your images, is to make your images a minimum of 1,000 by 1,000 pixels. — location: [758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=758) ^ref-37536

---
How do you choose an emotionally compelling image to use?  You want to make sure you get images that show a lot of the benefits that people are going to get from buying the product.  You want the kind of images that give them a glimpse of how happy they will be from using the product.  In other words, what the product is going to do for them, the product in action, and the product in the best light possible.  Turning pictures into emotionally compelling images is a lot easier than you think.  You can find product images by either asking your supplier, or buying stock photo.  Then you can go to Fiverr.com or Elance.com and hire a graphic designer to tweak the pictures for you.  They can add your product, brand or logo to the picture and adjust the picture to convey any message you want.  That is the magic of Photoshop. You can also get picture ideas from your competitors.  You can find stock photo that is similar to your competitor’s pictures, and edit them enough so that they become new pictures with your product and logo.  I am not saying take competitor’s product pictures and add them to your listing; remember we want to be unique, and that is just unethical.  Rather, borrow their picture ideas, get similar stock photo, and edit it until it is original and conveys the message you want to give your customers.  Remember, you need six to eight high quality pictures, so don’t settle for one or two.  Get as many as you can.  And the more pictures your customer has to look at, the more convinced they’ll be to buy.  Amazon does not allow you to add text to your pictures, so it is up to your images themselves to communicate the best message possible. — location: [761](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=761) ^ref-59978

---
I also put the title of the bullet in all caps and the details in regular letters.  This way it can really stand out for people who don’t like to read the details. — location: [778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=778) ^ref-34674

---
Here is an example of the bullets from the Cupcake Liner Listing: — location: [782](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=782) ^ref-36322

---
For the main product description in the middle of the page, I like to focus on the five P’s.  Now, the five P’s are designed to focus on the five things that will help motivate the customer most to buy your product. The five P’s include: — location: [793](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=793) ^ref-28575

---
I like offering a free EBook download in my listing.  They can get access to it through a postcard that I add in the product packaging.  The postcard then sends the customer to a website to download  their free eBooks.  The benefit of this is that I can capture their contact information and add them on my email list for future promotions. — location: [821](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=821) ^ref-20502

---
You can get great eBooks from private label rights websites that sell eBooks that deal with your specific subject.  They sell them for anywhere from $1.00 - $6.00, but once you buy it, you now have the rights to give it away to your customers as a free download as many times as you want. — location: [824](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=824) ^ref-30908

---
On a side note, in regards to shipping, your best bet is to stick with American carriers like FEDEX, UPS and DHL.  Stay away from the Chinese Delivery company called EMS.  If something goes wrong with your package, you won’t be able to speak with an English speaking person to resolve the issue. — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=888) ^ref-23842

---
You can usually get the supplier to give you wholesale pricing for the 10 – 20 units by telling them that you are buying them for testing purposes.  It also makes more sense to buy 10 – 20 to justify the large shipping cost. — location: [894](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=894) ^ref-50052

---
Test your titles by adding different benefits.  Keep swapping out benefits in your title to see which one most resonates with people.  Test the product name, too.  Test your images by rotating images, or swapping out images to see which works best.  Test your descriptions and bullet points by changing the five P’s (The problem, the promise, the picture, the proof, the push).  Test your bonuses.  Try one downloadable book, or give them another one.  Try one accessory, and if that doesn’t work, try another accessory.  Keep tweaking and testing, little by little, every day, until you find the listing that really resonates with customers (meaning that it will drive customers to buy). — location: [900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=900) ^ref-62255

---
You can expect it to be about two to three weeks before you actually get your first sale.  Sometimes, you can get sales right away (especially if you price for momentum), but don’t be discouraged if you don’t see a sale for two to three weeks. Once you do get sales, remember the focus is testing, not on making money.  You are only gathering data, so every situation is a learning opportunity.  Everything that does not go the way you want it, is an opportunity for you to learn and more streamline your process. — location: [919](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=919) ^ref-689

---
Expect to wait 60 days to have enough data to determine if your product is a winner or a loser.  Keep tweaking and testing everything until you start making daily sales, or until you conclude that there is no viable market for the product. — location: [926](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=926) ^ref-55422

---
Sales Validation.  If you can sell 10 products in a month, then you have a product that you can build a business around.  If you can't get 10 sales in a month, then forget it.  You probably don’t have a product that people are interested in.  Now this is good news, because it means you can avoid wasting time, but instead you can go out and look for another product and try it again. — location: [930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=930) ^ref-61946

---
4. Sales tax issues – Amazon stores your inventory in multiple warehouses in different states in order to quickly fulfill on orders.  Generally, states will tax you based on where you keep your inventory, so by using FBA you will have to file and pay sales tax in multiple states.  A solution for this is to pay to use Amazon’s FBA Inventory Placement option, and have all of your inventory stored in one warehouse.  Yet it is up to Amazon to pick the warehouse, which may or may not fit your needs. — location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=993) ^ref-46768

---
Train your supplier to package your product for you.  If your supplier is wiling (usually for an extra cost) have them print and assemble your logo packaging and inserts. 6. If you use FBA, train your supplier to package your products and send them to Amazon FBA directly. — location: [1040](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=1040) ^ref-52703

---
Other ways to capture customer information is by telling them about more bonuses that they can get access to if they sign up for your newsletter.  Again, that can be communicated to them through a little slip of paper you put in with the package you mail to them, directing them to sign up for your newsletter online.  After you get their contact information, you can email them and tell them about any new promotions or accessories that you have.  Or contact them on special occasions, like their birthday, or on a special holiday. — location: [1098](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=1098) ^ref-4001

---
You can also create a membership for your customers.  Contact them and let them know about the special membership that you offer, where they can get special promotions or different discounts for being part of that membership.  Then sell them exclusive products made just for them. — location: [1108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=1108) ^ref-62236

---
But an even more powerful way to do this is through COMP promotion codes you create on Amazon Seller Central. Imagine this for a moment.  You know a person in another state, that has agreed to give you an unbiased review in exchange for your free product.  If you use FBA, the simplest way to get them the product is to create a COMP code in Amazon Seller Central, and send it to them.  They then purchase the product through their Amazon account, using their COMP code to get it for free, and the product is automatically sent to them.  Once they get the product, they test it and they then give you a review. — location: [1164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=1164) ^ref-12987

---
You also have the option of hiring an Amazon listing creation service.  These are service providers that will design the entire Amazon product listing for you from scratch including: Titles, bullets, description, images, etc.  Though they are a bit more expensive, (anywhere from $100.00 to $500.00) it will be a good return on investment, especially if you’re making thousands of dollars in revenue. — location: [1226](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=1226) ^ref-58184

I could do this for others for a fee.

---
For example, if you’re selling a particular type of wine accessory, you have the option to sell many more types of wine accessories.  You can also sell complimentary products like a book on wine tasting, or a wine storage unit.  Next thing you know, you’re selling multiple wine accessory products at the same time, sometimes to multiple customers, or even to the same customer.  You’re now making money in a very expanded, scaled way. — location: [1277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LZ7PA7U&location=1277) ^ref-51312
