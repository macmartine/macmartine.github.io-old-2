      <p>Welcome to my digital garden of sorts. Here you will find germinating thoughts and budding ideas. Most of what is planted here here is evergreen and timeless, but other seeds make their way in on occasion. That's nature.</p>

      <p>It is in this garden, and in The Curious Innovator newsletter, where I share what I learn on the search for balance and harmony in the interplay between time and money, contentment and achievement, fulfillment and desire, present and future. Ya know, all those little things that humans struggle with daily. How we should live, are we doing the right thing, all that.</p>
