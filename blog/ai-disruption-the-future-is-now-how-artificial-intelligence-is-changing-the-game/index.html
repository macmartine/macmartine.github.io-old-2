				<h2>Exploration: AI Disruption: The Future is Now - How Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Game</h2>
<h3>Overview of the state of artificial intelligence</h3>
<p>AI has been all the rage lately, with tools like <a href='https://chat.openai.com' target='_blank'>ChatGPT</a> getting massive amounts of attention for its language capabilities, and <a href='https://www.midjourney.com/' target="_blank">Midjourney</a> and <a href='https://openai.com/dall-e-2/' target="_blank">DALL-E</a> for generating images from text prompts.</p>
<p>ChatGPT in particular has gained major traction for a wide-range of utilities, from article writing, to social media post writing, to creative writing, and even code generation and code debugging. And many have started to use it in place of Google.</p>
<p>With these advancements come major consequences across many industries; the question is: are we ready?</p>
<p>Today we're going to get an overview of the state of the effects these tools are having on the world today.</p>
<p>Let's start off with a look at what the tools that are getting the most attention from the masses right now.</p>
<h3>What is ChatGPT?</h3>
<p>At its core, ChatGPT behaves similar to how Google works in the sense of asking a question and getting a result. However, instead of scanning web pages and returning the page that Google thinks is the best result, ChatGPT is trained over a wide-array of resources, enabling it to interpret information and learn from it, and create unique responses that don't stem from a particular source. This allows it to respond in ways Google simply can't, including the ability to be creative.</p>
<p>Those are my words though; let's see how ChatGPT describes itself, shall we?</p>
<p><img src="/img/2023-01-20/chat-gpt-what-is-chat-gpt.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Got it?</p>
<h3>What are Midjourney and DALL-E?</h3>
<p><a href='https://www.midjourney.com/' target="_blank">Midjourney</a> and <a href='https://openai.com/dall-e-2/' target="_blank">DALL-E</a> are just a couple examples of a number of AI image generators. They are able to take a prompt and generate an image from it.</p>
<p>Here's an example from Midjourney, where I gave it the prompt: &quot;a troll in a forest with vibrant colors and surreal sky&quot;, and got the following four images back:</p>
<p><img src="/img/2023-01-20/midjourney-troll.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>Now that we have a general understanding of what these tools are, let's dive into how they are changing the world today.</p>

<h3>AI and social media</h3>
<p>The way these tools are starting to affect the masses the most today is most clearly seen in social media and the internet.</p>
<p>With ChatGPT, a user can do pretty much anything they want with it on their own. However, there have been a huge number of tools released lately to leverage this type of AI for specific purposes, such as writing social media posts for you, Tweets, LinkedIn posts, blog posts, articles, even <a href='https://emailtree.ai/fastest-email-composer/ai-email-response-generator/' target='_blank'>reply to your emails</a>, or <a href="https://detangle.ai/" target='_blank'>summarize legal documents</a> in layman's terms.</p>
<p>It's now easy to generate and schedule a month's worth of social media posts that are fairly well-written about a subject, without having to do much of anything, or even know anything about the subject. Enter the world of robots acting as the facade of humans; sometimes people can <a href='https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1604841600416624642' target='_blank'>tell the difference</a>, but most of the time they can't. And honestly, most people aren't yet aware that they should consider this a possibility.</p>
<p>The core purpose of social media, at least on a personal level of getting to know others online, following interesting people, and staying in touch with old friends is getting become less trustworthy. Sure, there have been bots online for a while now, but it's been pretty clear when you're dealing with a bot. Now any individual may or may not be running their online presence with a bot. It certainly has me questioning the value of social media going forward, and it should for you too.</p>
<h3>AI and the internet</h3>
<p>The ability to have AI tools like ChatGPT generate massive amounts of content is also concerning, for Google as well as consumers. It's going to be really hard for humans and businesses to stand out online, and determining what is real or true is going to get very difficult when it comes to content, social media, and images and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4G6GNFz0O8' target='_blank'>videos</a>, on both a personal and a business level.</p>
<p>I asked ChaptGPT how we might go about detecting if a particular piece of content was generated from AI. Here's what it said:</p>
<p><img src="/img/2023-01-20/chat-gpt-detecting-ai-content.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This seems fairly accurate. It doesn't always read naturally, it can't reason, and it can indeed feel too perfect. It's not aware of branding styles nor does it have a personal voice.</p>
<p>But it's pretty good, and it's still early. It won't be long before the internet of today will no longer be recognizable.</p>
<p>It should be clear by now that even in the near-term the effects will be huge. We need to start changing our habits and behaviors online, and there's already a huge shift happening.</p>
<p>Maggie Appleton has a <a href='https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest' target='_blank'>great article</a> where she discusses the impacts of AI on search results and its impact on being a human with an online presence, and engaging on an internet that is half human (maybe) and half AI.</p>
<p>I firmly believe most public social media platforms will before long become useless for most purposes. Who wants to spend time engaging with AI generated content? As a result, we'll continue to see a huge rise in gated online communities where it will be easier to keep things real.</p>
<h3>AI and business writing</h3>
<p>ChaptGPT is already making many writers nervous. Especially in the case of basic copywriting, content generation, product descriptions, and the like. I've already seen a number of writers express real concern about this.</p>
<p>In fact, my wife is currently writing product descriptions for a large apparel company that you've heard of, and the agency she's working through has an AI tool the writers are to use to write the first draft of their product descriptions. The copywriter is then meant to tweak the output to suit the brand's identity, style, and tone. While this is one area AI falls short today, these tools can be trained to learn, so when the ability to train these models gets accessible enough, that'll be game-changing yet again, and incredibly disruptive. It's at that point writers like her will rarely be needed.</p>
<h3>AI and creative writing and the arts</h3>
<p>We weren't expecting AI to affect creative jobs so quickly, and there was hardly a mention of it until recently.
It turns out that AI is actually quite good at creative tasks, both in writing as well as generating graphics and images.</p>
<p>Even just a few years ago, the predictions of what AI would affect first almost never included creative pursuits. However, we're already seeing <a href='https://time.com/6240569/ai-childrens-book-alice-and-sparkle-artists-unhappy/' target='_blank'>published</a> books being written with AI.</p>
<p>If you have your doubts, <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html' target='_blank'>AI just won an art award</a></p>
<h3>AI and education</h3>
<p>AI is going to hit the education system hard, and universities are already <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/technology/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-universities.html?' target='_blank'>grappling with this</a>.</p>
<p>Why write a paper when you can just ask AI to write a better one in a few seconds? Want it simply articulated for a 5-year-old, or would you prefer it read like a legal document or scientific journal? Just say so.</p>
<p>Need the answer to a question that's beyond the capabilities of Google, or need some code written for you (and yes, I've already been using it for this)? Done.</p>
<p>It will be so easy to cheat (and it already is) that it seems almost hopeless to try to stop it. Trying to stay ahead of technology in this way will be an enormous feat for universities. They'll need to find a different way.</p>
<p>At the same time, the advancements in AI will greatly alter what is important to learn. For example, it's easy to argue now that communication skills are important, but ChatGPT has the potential to change that.</p>
<p>I can just ask it to re-write a rude thought in a professional and polite way.</p>
<p>Let's try it:</p>
<p><img src="/img/2023-01-20/chat-gpt.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Job saved, phew!</p>
<p>Imagine an email client that automatically detects poor tone and alerts you while proposing changes? People have already tried this, and it's about to get much more robust.</p>
<p>The invention of the calculator had similar effects. Yes, we still teach math in school, but the reality of it is that most of us only require the most rudimentary math skills in our day-to-day. And for anything we can't do in our head, we're going to pull out our phone and use the calculator, or ask Siri.</p>
<p>I'm not saying we should stop prioritizing communication skills, or math, rather my intent is to highlight some of the questions this brings up.</p>
<p>Even before AI, the education system has a lot of overdue overhauling to do. It's an antiquated system at this point. (And don't even get me started on all the basic life skills that are never taught in school but used by the majority of the world's population on a daily basis.) But this change won't be led by the government or public school system, and probably not by the universities either. It'll take an Elon Musk type (or Elon himself), that comes along and flips the system on its head. There are already rumbles of that happening with extracurricular courses like <a href='https://www.synthesis.com/' target='_blank'>Synthesis</a> (which, coincidentally or not, originated at SpaceX). The focus here is on working collaboratively with people all around the world, and problem-solving as a group. My son was in a Synthesis group for while and it was far from anything you see in schools today.</p>
<p>But who knows how long a transformation like that will take. Even when it does while it'll likely only be available to upper-class families who can afford expensive private schools for a while.</p>
<p>This all reinforces my main goal for my kids' education - my priorities for them do not revolve around them going to the best schools and getting the best grades, as much as developing an interest in learning, an ability to learn on their own, and being honest. Armed with that, I believe they'll be fine.</p>
<h3>Finally, because you should be wondering:</h3>
<p>None of this post was written with AI, except for the title:</p>
<p><img src="/img/2023-01-20/chat-gpt-rewrite-headline.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Good luck out there.</p>
