<p>Like driving down a lonely highway on a dark, foggy night, entrepreneurship can be a little scary. But keep your foot on the gas anyway. As Mark Cuban said, “It doesn’t matter how many times you fail. Each time only makes you better, stronger, smarter, and you only have to be right once. Just once.” You might struggle, you might falter, you might fail. But keep going. Entrepreneurship, whether it’s through real estate investing or something entirely different, has the power to change your life. You only need to be right once to have a lifetime of financial independence. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07HY1LRCS&amp;location=1016">1016</a> ^ref-12638</p>

<p>That’s why many investors will purchase those residential properties in their own name (as a sole proprietor) and then, after the purchase, will transfer the property into their corporation. Seems simple enough, but this also presents some risk because of a clause in nearly every mortgage known as a “due on sale clause.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07HY1LRCS&amp;location=1563">1563</a> ^ref-14662</p>

<p>After learning that another duplex down the road from his was being rented out for a significant amount more, due to an added half bath, Darren moved out, added a half bath to each unit, and raised the rents to $1,600 per unit. He still owns that property today and rents out each unit for more than $3,000 per month. He enjoys figuring out ways to add value to property in the most cost-effective way. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07HY1LRCS&amp;location=1760">1760</a> ^ref-34867</p>

<p>Darren also understands that one of the largest expenses with many rental properties is the natural wear and tear from tenants. Therefore, when he rehabs a property, he chooses to go the higher-quality route and does his best to make it “tenant-proof.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07HY1LRCS&amp;location=1768">1768</a> ^ref-59460</p>

<p>You can invest from $50,000 up to whatever you want,’ ” explains Andrew. When the property is refurbished and released, Andrew either sells or refinances it with a bank, returning the investors’ money with a healthy return and then holding for cash flow (which investors continue to receive as well). Then it’s on to the next investment. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07HY1LRCS&amp;location=1809">1809</a> ^ref-42296</p>

<p>Real estate agents love to get their leads from these expired listings. Many agents make it a regular practice to call all the expired listings in their area and try to get the homeowner to list the home again, this time with that agent.
