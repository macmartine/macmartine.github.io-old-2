<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>Look at the aggression that is now openly displayed in the virtual world, where it is so much easier to play out our shadow sides without repercussions. Notice how our propensities to compare ourselves with others, to feel envy, and to seek status through attention have only become intensified with our ability to communicate so quickly with so many people. And finally, look at our tribal tendencies and how they have now found the perfect medium to operate in—we can find a group to identify with, reinforce our tribal opinions in a virtual echo chamber, and demonize any outsiders, leading to mob intimidation. The potential for mayhem stemming from the primitive side of our nature has only increased. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=236">236</a> ^ref-61383</p>

<p>people are generally dealing with emotions and issues that have deep roots. They’re experiencing some desires and disappointments that predate you by years and decades. You cross their path at a particular moment and become the convenient target of their anger or frustration. They’re projecting onto you certain qualities they want to see. In most cases, they’re not relating to you as an individual. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=251">251</a> ^ref-52051</p>
<hr>
<p>You will think in terms of opposites—when people overtly display some trait, such as confidence or hypermasculinity, they are most often concealing the contrary reality. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=263">263</a> ^ref-23976</p>
<hr>
<p>If people take an action that seems out of character, you will take note: what often appears out of character is actually more of their true character. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=266">266</a> ^ref-46667</p>
<hr>
<p>Instead of being weighed down by these encounters, you might even come to appreciate them as a chance to hone your skills of self-mastery and toughen yourself up. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=279">279</a> ^ref-37822</p>
<hr>
<p>when we meet resistance to our ideas or plans, we cannot help trying to directly change people’s minds by arguing, lecturing, or cajoling them, all of which makes them more defensive. The Laws will teach you that people are naturally stubborn and resistant to influence. You must begin any attempt by lowering their resistance and never inadvertently feeding their defensive tendencies. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=282">282</a> ^ref-49955</p>
<hr>
<p>Understanding the permeability of emotions, you will learn that the most effective means of influence is to alter your moods and attitude. People are responding to your energy and demeanor even more than to your words. You will get rid of any defensiveness on your part. Instead, feeling relaxed and genuinely interested in the other person will have a positive and hypnotic effect. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=286">286</a> ^ref-38911</p>

<p>Your goal is to simply see their point of view better. As you go through this process, it becomes like a muscle that gets stronger the more you exercise it. Cultivating such empathy will have innumerable benefits. We are all self-absorbed, locked in our own worlds. It is a therapeutic and liberating experience to be drawn outside ourselves and into the world of another. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=311">311</a> ^ref-18935</p>

<p>Athena was the guiding spirit of Athens, the goddess of wisdom and practical intelligence. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=386">386</a> ^ref-38493</p>

<p>The solution he came up with is unique in history and devastatingly powerful in its results. It should serve as our ideal. In his conception, the human mind has to worship something, has to have its attention directed to something it values above all else. For most people, it is their ego; for some it is their family, their clan, their god, or their nation. For Pericles it would be nous, the ancient Greek word for “mind” or “intelligence.” Nous is a force that permeates the universe, creating meaning and order. The human mind is naturally attracted to this order; this is the source of our intelligence. For Pericles, the nous that he worshipped was embodied in the figure of the goddess Athena. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=461">461</a> ^ref-10031</p>
<hr>
<p>In essence, Athena stood for rationality, the greatest gift of the gods to mortals, for it alone could make a human act with divine wisdom. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=472">472</a> ^ref-8844</p>

<p>moment, to never make a decision while under the influence of a strong emotion. Instead, he analyzed his feelings. Usually when he looked closely at his insecurities or his anger, he saw that they were not really justified, and they lost their significance under scrutiny. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=476">476</a> ^ref-53032</p>
<hr>
<p>He decided to base all of his political decisions on one thing—what actually served the greater good of Athens. His goal was to unify the citizenry through genuine love of democracy and belief in the superiority of the Athenian way. Having such a standard helped him avoid the ego trap. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=479">479</a> ^ref-13700</p>
<hr>
<p>The voice of Athena simply stands for a higher power that exists within you right now, a potential you have perhaps felt in moments of calmness and focus, the perfect idea coming to you after much thinking. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=489">489</a> ^ref-15061</p>
<hr>
<p>Your first task is to look at those emotions that are continually infecting your ideas and decisions. Learn to question yourself: Why this anger or resentment? Where does this incessant need for attention come from? Under such scrutiny, your emotions will lose their hold on you. You will begin to think for yourself instead of reacting to what others give you. Emotions tend to narrow the mind, making us focus on one or two ideas that satisfy our immediate desire for power or attention, ideas that usually backfire. Now, with a calm spirit, you can entertain a wide range of options and solutions. You will deliberate longer before acting and reassess your strategies. The voice will become clearer and clearer. When people besiege you with their endless dramas and petty emotions, you will resent the distraction and apply your rationality to think past them. Like an athlete continually getting stronger through training, your mind will become more flexible and resilient. Clear and calm, you will see answers and creative solutions that no one else can envision. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=495">495</a> ^ref-49508</p>
<hr>
<p>Certainly there are individuals and larger forces out there that continually have an effect on us, and there is much we cannot control in the world. But generally what causes us to go astray in the first place, what leads to bad decisions and miscalculations, is our deep-rooted irrationality, the extent to which our minds are governed by emotion. We cannot see this. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=518">518</a> ^ref-58157</p>
<hr>
<p>this evolution has led to the higher mammalian brain being composed of three parts. The oldest is the reptilian part of the brain, which controls all automatic responses that regulate the body. This is the instinctive part. Above that is the old mammalian or limbic brain, governing feeling and emotion. And on top of that has evolved the neocortex, the part that controls cognition and, for humans, language. Emotions originate as physical arousal designed to capture our attention and cause us to take notice of something around us. They begin as chemical reactions and sensations that we must then translate into words to try to understand. But because they are processed in a different part of the brain from language and thinking, this translation is often slippery and inaccurate. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=561">561</a> ^ref-31065</p>
<hr>
<p>we do not have conscious access to the origins of our emotions and the moods they generate. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=573">573</a> ^ref-65166</p>
<hr>
<p>Rational people are aware of this and through introspection and effort are able, to some extent, to subtract emotions from their thinking and counteract their effect. Irrational people have no such awareness. They rush into action without carefully considering the ramifications and consequences. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=596">596</a> ^ref-45659</p>
<hr>
<p>So it is important to judge over time whether a person is rational or irrational. Can they sustain success and hit upon several good strategies? Can they adjust and learn from failures? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=603">603</a> ^ref-60584</p>
<hr>
<p>Rational people can readily admit their own irrational tendencies and the need to be vigilant. On the other hand, irrational people become highly emotional when challenged about the emotional roots of their decisions. They are incapable of introspection and learning. Their mistakes make them increasingly defensive. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=615">615</a> ^ref-20473</p>
<hr>
<p>Pericles wanted the energy that comes from impulses and emotions to serve our thinking self. That was his vision of rationality, and our ideal. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=620">620</a> ^ref-60442</p>
<hr>
<p>Fortunately, to acquire rationality is not complicated. It simply requires knowing and working through a three-step process. First, we must become aware of what we shall call low-grade irrationality. This is a function of the continual moods and feelings that we experience in life, below the level of consciousness. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=622">622</a> ^ref-19303</p>
<hr>
<p>Second, we must understand the nature of what we shall call high-grade irrationality. This occurs when our emotions become inflamed, generally because of certain pressures. As we think about our anger, excitement, resentment, or suspicion, it intensifies into a reactive state—everything we see or hear is interpreted through the lens of this emotion. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=627">627</a> ^ref-41278</p>
<hr>
<p>Third, we need to enact certain strategies and exercises that will strengthen the thinking part of the brain and give it more power in the eternal struggle with our emotions. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=633">633</a> ^ref-29574</p>
<hr>
<p>This pleasure principle in thinking is the source of all of our mental biases. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=640">640</a> ^ref-26843</p>
<hr>
<p>In general, you should never accept the validity of people’s ideas because they have supplied “evidence.” Instead, examine the evidence yourself in the cold light of day, with as much skepticism as you can muster. Your first impulse should always be to find the evidence that disconfirms your most cherished beliefs and those of others. That is true science. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=655">655</a> ^ref-43756</p>
<hr>
<p>Low-grade emotions continually affect our thinking, and they originate from our own impulses—for instance, the desire for pleasing and comforting thoughts. High-grade emotion, however, comes at certain moments, reaches an explosive pitch, and is generally sparked by something external—a person who gets under our skin, or particular circumstances. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=701">701</a> ^ref-12968</p>
<hr>
<p>You should also be aware of high-grade irrationality in others, to either get out of their way or help bring them back to reality. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=708">708</a> ^ref-56685</p>
<hr>
<p>In the midst of such an attack, we must struggle to detach ourselves and contemplate the possible source—the wound in early childhood—and the patterns it has locked us into. This deep understanding of ourselves and our vulnerabilities is a key step toward becoming rational. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=731">731</a> ^ref-60804</p>
<hr>
<p>Sudden success or winnings can be very dangerous. Neurologically, chemicals are released in the brain that give a powerful jolt of arousal and energy, leading to the desire to repeat this experience. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=734">734</a> ^ref-26508</p>
<hr>
<p>whenever you experience unusual gains or losses, that is precisely the time to step back and counterbalance them with some necessary pessimism or optimism. Be extra wary of sudden success and attention—they are not built on anything that lasts and they have an addictive pull. And the fall is always painful. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=744">744</a> ^ref-18731</p>
<hr>
<p>Whenever you notice rising pressure and stress levels in your life, you must watch yourself carefully. Monitor any signs of unusual brittleness or sensitivity, sudden suspicions, fears disproportionate to the circumstances. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=751">751</a> ^ref-26213</p>
<hr>
<p>Rationality is something to be acquired by individuals, not by mass movements or technological progress. Feeling superior and beyond it is a sure sign that the irrational is at work. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=794">794</a> ^ref-15056</p>
<hr>
<p>All of these types share certain qualities—a realistic appraisal of themselves and their weaknesses; a devotion to truth and reality; a tolerant attitude toward people; and the ability to reach goals that they have set. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=800">800</a> ^ref-14358</p>
<hr>
<p>greater rationality. This often comes with what we shall call the maker’s mind-set. We have a project to get done, perhaps with a deadline. The only emotion we can afford is excitement and energy. Other emotions simply make it impossible to concentrate. Because we have to get results, we become exceptionally practical. We focus on the work—our mind calm, our ego not intruding. If people try to interrupt or infect us with emotions, we resent it. These moments—as fleeting as a few weeks or hours—reveal the rational self that is waiting to come out. It just requires some awareness and some practice. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=803">803</a> ^ref-38410</p>
<hr>
<p>Therefore, your first step toward the rational is always inward. You want to catch that Emotional Self in action. For this purpose, you must reflect on how you operate under stress. What particular weaknesses come out in such moments—the desire to please, to bully or control, deep levels of mistrust? Look at your decisions, especially those that have been ineffective—can you see a pattern, an underlying insecurity that impels them? Examine your strengths, what makes you different from other people. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=809">809</a> ^ref-7339</p>
<hr>
<p>Examine your emotions to their roots. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=815">815</a> ^ref-3382</p>
<hr>
<p>Instead, see other people as phenomena, as neutral as comets or plants. They simply exist. They come in all varieties, making life rich and interesting. Work with what they give you, instead of resisting and trying to change them. Make understanding people a fun game, the solving of puzzles. It is all part of the human comedy. Yes, people are irrational, but so are you. Make your acceptance of human nature as radical as possible. This will calm you down and help you observe people more dispassionately, understanding them on a deeper level. You will stop projecting your own emotions on to them. All of this will give you more balance and calmness, more mental space for thinking. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=831">831</a> ^ref-11856</p>

<p>He applied his training as a doctor to the human animal, his goal to understand what makes us so irrational, so unhappy, and so dangerous. In his stories and plays, he found it immensely therapeutic to get inside his characters and make sense of even the worst types. In this way, he could forgive anybody, even his father. His approach in these cases was to imagine that each person, no matter how twisted, has a reason for what they’ve become, a logic that makes sense to them. In their own way, they are striving for fulfillment, but irrationally. By stepping back and imagining their story from the inside, Chekhov demythologized the brutes and aggressors; he cut them down to human size. They no longer elicited hatred but rather pity. You must think more like a writer in approaching the people you deal with, even the worst sorts. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=839">839</a> ^ref-7475</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks had an appropriate metaphor for this: the rider and the horse. The horse is our emotional nature continually impelling us to move. This horse has tremendous energy and power, but without a rider it cannot be guided; it is wild, subject to predators, and continually heading into trouble. The rider is our thinking self. Through training and practice, it holds the reins and guides the horse, transforming this powerful animal energy into something productive. The one without the other is useless. Without the rider, no directed movement or purpose. Without the horse, no energy, no power. In most people the horse dominates, and the rider is weak.

<p>try to maintain a perfect balance between skepticism (rider) and curiosity (horse). In this mode you are skeptical about your own enthusiasms and those of others. You do not accept at face value people’s explanations and their application of “evidence.” You look at the results of their actions, not what they say about their motivations. But if you take this too far, your mind will close itself off from wild ideas, from exciting speculations, from curiosity itself. You want to retain the elasticity of spirit you had as a child, interested in everything, while retaining… — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=856">856</a> ^ref-31378</p>

<p>If our parents encourage us in our first efforts at independence, if they validate our need to feel strong and recognize our unique qualities, then our self-image takes root, and we can slowly build upon it. Deep narcissists have a sharp break in this early development, and so they never quite construct a consistent and realistic feeling of a self. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=913">913</a> ^ref-15808</p>
<hr>
<p>Various studies have indicated a gradual increase in levels of self-absorption and narcissism in young people since the late 1970s, with a much higher spike since 2000. Much of this can be attributed to technology and the internet. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1010">1010</a> ^ref-64634</p>
<hr>
<p>Deep narcissism tends to sink you deeper, as your connection to reality lessens and you are unable to really develop your work or your relationships. Empathy does the opposite. As you increasingly turn your attention outward, you get constant positive feedback. People want to be around you more. You develop your empathic muscle; your work improves; without trying, you gain the attention that all humans thrive on. Empathy creates its own upward, positive momentum. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1022">1022</a> ^ref-52280</p>
<hr>
<p>you must begin with the assumption that you are ignorant and that you have natural biases that will make you judge people incorrectly. The people around you present a mask that suits their purposes. You mistake the mask for reality. Let go of your tendency to make snap judgments. Open your mind to seeing people in a new light. Do not assume that you are similar or that they share your values. Each person you meet is like an undiscovered country, with a very particular psychological chemistry that you will carefully explore. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1027">1027</a> ^ref-39263</p>

<p>Try reversing your normal impulse to talk and give your opinion, desiring instead to hear the other person’s point of view. You have tremendous curiosity in this direction. Cut off your incessant interior monologue as best you can. Give full attention to the other. What matters here is the quality of your listening, so that in the course of the conversation you can mirror back to the other person things they said, or things that were left unsaid but that you sensed. This will have a tremendous seductive effect. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1034">1034</a> ^ref-8214</p>
<hr>
<p>When we make a mistake, we attribute it to circumstances that pushed us into doing it. But when others make a mistake, we tend to see it as a character flaw, as something that flowed from their imperfect personality. This is known as the attribution bias. You must work against this. With an empathic attitude, you consider first the circumstances that might have made a person do what they did, giving them the same benefit of the doubt as you give yourself. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1038">1038</a> ^ref-56521</p>
<hr>
<p>adopting this attitude depends on the quality of your self-love. If you feel terribly superior to others, or gripped by insecurities, your moments of empathy and absorption in people will be shallow. What you need is a complete acceptance of your character, including your flaws, which you can see clearly but even appreciate and love. You are not perfect. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1042">1042</a> ^ref-8578</p>

<p>Pay deep attention to the moods of people, as indicated by their body language and tone of voice. When they talk, they have a feeling tone that is either in sync or not in sync with what they are saying. This tone can be one of confidence, insecurity, defensiveness, arrogance, frustration, elation. This tone manifests itself physically in their voice, their gestures, and their posture. In each encounter, you must try to detect this before even paying attention to what they are saying. This will register to you viscerally, in your own physical response to them. A defensive tone on their part will tend to create a like feeling in you. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1049">1049</a> ^ref-42788</p>

<p>People who are connecting physically and emotionally in a conversation will tend to mimic each other’s gestures and posture, both crossing their legs, for instance. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1069">1069</a> ^ref-25874</p>

<p>while physical empathy is extremely powerful, it must be supplemented by analytic empathy. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1080">1080</a> ^ref-56644</p>
<hr>
<p>Analytic empathy comes mostly through conversation and gathering information that will allow you to get inside the spirit of others. Some pieces of information are more valuable than others. For instance, you want to get a read on people’s values, which are mostly established in their earliest years. People develop concepts of what they consider strong, sensitive, generous, and weak often based on their parents and their relationship to them. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1084">1084</a> ^ref-1990</p>
<hr>
<p>Your goal, then, is to gather as much as you can about the early years of the people you are studying and their relationship to their parents and siblings. Keep in mind that their current relationship to family will also speak volumes about the past. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1090">1090</a> ^ref-60675</p>

<p>Your goal in general is to find out what makes them unique. You are looking precisely for what is different from yourself and the other people you know. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1096">1096</a> ^ref-18215</p>
<hr>
<p>The key to employing empathy within a relationship is to understand the value system of the other person, which inevitably is different from yours. What they interpret as signs of love or attention or generosity tends to diverge from your way of thinking. These value systems are largely formed in early childhood and are not consciously created by people. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1353">1353</a> ^ref-1333</p>

<p>If we feel our survival depends on how well we gauge the moods and minds of others, then we will find the requisite focus and tap into the powers. Normally we do not feel the need for this. We imagine that we understand quite well the people we deal with. Life can be harsh and we have too many other tasks to attend to. We are lazy and prefer to rely upon predigested judgments. But in fact it is a matter of life and death and our success does depend on the development of these skills. We simply are not aware of this because we do not see the connection between problems in our lives and our constant misreading of people’s moods and intentions and the endless missed opportunities that accrue from this. The first step, then, is the most important: to realize you have a remarkable social tool that you are not cultivating. The best way to see this is to try it out. Stop your incessant interior monologue and pay deeper attention to people. Attune yourself to the shifting moods of individuals and the group. Get a read on each person’s particular psychology and what motivates them. Try to take their perspective, enter their world and value system. You will suddenly become aware of an entire world of nonverbal behavior you never knew existed, as if your eyes could now suddenly see ultraviolet light. Once you sense this power, you will feel its importance and awaken to new social possibilities. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1445">1445</a> ^ref-12445</p>

<p>nonverbal communication cannot be experienced simply through thinking and translating thoughts into words but must be felt physically as one engages with the facial expressions or locked positions of other people. It is a different form of knowledge, one that connects with the animal part of our nature and involves our mirror neurons. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1580">1580</a> ^ref-11594</p>

<p>Your task is simple: First you must recognize your state of self-absorption and how little you actually observe. With this understanding you will be motivated to develop observation skills. Second you must understand, as Erickson did, the different nature of this form of communication. It requires opening up your senses and relating to people more on the physical level, absorbing their physical energy and not just their words. You do not simply observe their facial expression, but you register it from within, so that the impression stays with you and communicates. As you gain greater vocabulary in this language, you will be able to correlate a gesture with a possible emotion. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1600">1600</a> ^ref-37395</p>

<p>Your task as a student of human nature is twofold: First, you must understand and accept the theatrical quality of life. You do not moralize and rail against the role-playing and the wearing of masks so essential to smooth social functioning. In fact, your goal is to play your part on the stage of life with consummate skill, attracting attention, dominating the limelight, and making yourself into a sympathetic hero or heroine. Second, you must not be naive and mistake people’s appearances for reality. You are not blinded by people’s acting skills. You transform yourself into a master decoder of their true feelings, working on your observation skills and practicing them as much as you can in daily life. And so, for these purposes, there are three aspects to this particular law: understanding how to observe people; learning some basic keys for decoding nonverbal communication; and mastering the art of what is known as impression management, playing your role to maximum effect. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1648">1648</a> ^ref-65273</p>

<p>In a casual conversation with someone, give yourself the goal of observing one or two facial expressions that seem to go against what the person is saying or indicate some additional information. Be attentive to microexpressions, quick flashes on the face of tension, or forced smiles (see the next section for more on this). Once you succeed in this simple exercise with one person, try it with someone else, always focusing on the face. Once you find it easier to notice cues from the face, attempt to make a similar observation about an individual’s voice, noting any changes in pitch or the pace of talking. The voice says a lot about people’s level of confidence and their contentment. Later on graduate to elements of body language—such as posture, hand gestures, positioning of legs. Keep these exercises simple, having simple goals. Write down any observations, particularly any patterns you notice. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1666">1666</a> ^ref-41778</p>

<p>In observing any particular individual over time, you need to establish their baseline expression and mood. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1677">1677</a> ^ref-22855</p>

<p>Related to the baseline expression, try to observe the same person in different settings, noticing how their nonverbal cues change if they are talking to a spouse, a boss, an employee. For another exercise, observe people who are about to do something exciting—a trip to some alluring place, a date with someone they’ve been pursuing, or any event for which they have high expectations. Note the looks of anticipation, how the eyes open wider and stay there, the face flushed and generally animated, a slight smile on the lips as they think of what’s about to come. Contrast this with the tension exhibited by a person about to take a test or go on a job interview. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1684">1684</a> ^ref-9215</p>

<p>You will pay attention to people’s silences, the clothes they wear, the arrangement of objects on their desk, their breathing patterns, the tension in certain muscles (particularly in the neck), the subtext in their conversations—what is not said or what is implied. All of these discoveries should excite and impel you to go further. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1702">1702</a> ^ref-14526</p>

<p>As part of your practice, try to observe yourself as well. Notice how often and when you tend to put on a fake smile, or how your body registers nervousness—in your voice, the drumming of your fingers, the twiddling with your hair, the quivering of your lips, and so on. Becoming acutely aware of your own nonverbal behavior will make you more sensitive and alert to the signals of others. You will be better able to imagine the emotions that go with the cue. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1723">1723</a> ^ref-49117</p>

<p>The microexpression is a recent discovery among psychologists who have been able to document its existence through film. It lasts less than a second. There are two varieties of this: The first comes when people are aware of a negative feeling and try to suppress it, but it leaks out in a fraction of a second. The other comes when we are unaware of their hostility and yet it shows itself in quick flashes on the face or in the body. These expressions will be a momentary glare, tensing of the facial muscles, pursing of the lips, the beginnings of a frown or sneer or look of contempt, with the eyes looking down. Aware of this phenomenon, we can look for these expressions. You will be surprised at how often they occur, because it is nearly impossible to completely control the facial muscles and repress the signs in time. You must be relaxed and attentive, not obviously looking for them but catching them out of the corner of your eye. Once you begin to notice such expressions, you will find it easier to catch them. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1751">1751</a> ^ref-29381</p>

<p>Take notice of people who praise or flatter you without their eyes lighting up. This could be a sign of hidden envy. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1770">1770</a> ^ref-30581</p>

<p>An excellent gauge for decoding antagonism is to compare people’s body language toward you and toward others. You might detect that they are noticeably friendlier and warmer toward other people and then put on a polite mask with you. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1777">1777</a> ^ref-4155</p>

<p>If you suspect someone of feeling envy, talk about the latest good news for you without appearing to brag. Look for microexpressions of disappointment on their face. Use similar tests to probe for hidden anger and resentments, eliciting the responses that people cannot suppress so quickly. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1789">1789</a> ^ref-6058</p>

<p>people who feel positive emotions for you will display noticeable signs of relaxation in the facial muscles, particularly in the lines of the forehead and the area around the mouth; their lips will appear more fully exposed and the whole area around their eyes will widen. These are all involuntary expressions of comfort and openness. If the feelings are more intense, such as falling in love, blood rushes to the face, animating all of the features. As part of this excited state the pupils will dilate, an automatic response in which the eyes let in more light. It is a sure sign that a person is comfortable and likes what they are seeing. Along with the dilation the eyebrows will rise, making the eyes look even bigger. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1802">1802</a> ^ref-31113</p>

<p>the voice is very difficult to consciously modulate. When people are engaged and excited to talk to you, the pitch of their voice rises, indicating emotional arousal. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1817">1817</a> ^ref-21598</p>

<p>When people start to feel comfortable in your presence, they will stand closer to you or lean in, their arms not folded or revealing any tension. If you are giving a talk or telling a story, frequent head nods, attentive gazes, and genuine smiles will indicate that people agree with what you are saying and are losing their resistance. They exchange more looks. Perhaps the best and most exciting sign of all is synchrony, the other person unconsciously mirroring you. Their legs cross in the same direction, the head tilts in a similar manner, one smile inducing another. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1824">1824</a> ^ref-54936</p>

<p>Confidence usually comes with a greater feeling of relaxation that is clearly reflected in the face, and with a greater freedom of movement. Those who are powerful will feel allowed to look around more at others, choosing to make eye contact with whomever they please. Their eyelids are more closed, a sign of seriousness and competence. If they feel bored or annoyed, they show it more freely and openly. They often smile less, frequent smiling being a sign of overall insecurity. They feel more entitled to touch people, such as with friendly pats on the back or on the arm. In a meeting, they will tend to take up more space and create more distance around themselves. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1843">1843</a> ^ref-27455</p>

<p>Leaders who display tension and hesitation in their nonverbal cues are generally insecure in their power and feel it threatened. Signs of such anxiety and insecurity are generally easy to spot. They will talk in a more halting manner, with long pauses. Their voice will rise in pitch and stay there. They will tend to avert their gaze and control their eye movements, although they will often blink more. They will put on more forced smiles and emit nervous laughs. As opposed to feeling entitled to touch others, they will tend to touch themselves in what is known as pacifying behavior. They will touch their hair, their neck, their forehead, all in an attempt to soothe their nerves. People trying to hide their insecurities will assert themselves a little too loudly in a conversation, their voices rising. As they do this, they look around nervously, eyes wide open. Or as they talk in an animated way, their hands and bodies are unusually still, always a sign of anxiety. They will inevitably give off mixed signals, and you must pay greater attention to those that signal underlying insecurity. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07BJLX414&amp;location=1864">1864</a> ^ref-40441</p>
