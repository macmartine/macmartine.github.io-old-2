<h3>Backstory</h3>
<h4>Your problem or challenge</h4>
<p>Wanted control of my time. Hated meetings, hated having to be places at a certain time. Hated having to sit at a desk for 8 hours a day regardless of what I was getting done.</p>
<p>Wanted to be able to get rewarded for my efforts. The harded I worked, the more money I made for someone else.</p>
<h4>Internal struggles</h4>
<p>I wasn't sure what to make. Tried to marry my passions with something I could sell and make money off of. I was thinking of ideas that were too big. I should have started with smaller things. Make $1 this month, etc.</p>
<h4>External struggles</h4>
<p>I saw people all around making a living building products.</p>
<h4>What was your change event?</h4>
<p>I created the podcast.</p>
<p>I stopped caring if I was passionate about this idea. I started talking to people and getting better and listening for the actual pains, not 'cool feature ideas'.</p>
<h4>What was the spark?</h4>
<p>I realized the people that were successful we just ordinary people. They weren't necessarily smarter than me, nor did they have more valuable skills than me, or skills I didn't have. They just kept trying things, and eventually something hit.</p>
<h4>Who was your guide?</h4>
<p>Books and podcasts and blogs were my guide.</p>
<h4>What was the result? I kept at it, and eventually probability played out.</h4>
<h3>Polarization</h3>
<p>Have strong opinions. Don't be wishy-washy.</p>
<h3>Tell a story</h3>
<p>Make a powerful statement to start: &quot;I left to rat race&quot;</p>
<p>Second line is a head-scratcher: &quot;My secret sauce is less ambition&quot;</p>
<p>Tell real stories.</p>
<h3>Todo:</h3>
<p>Craft 3-5 relatable lessions</p>
<h2>Lesson 2:  Content Creation</h2>
<h3>Choosing content paths</h3>
<p>It's important for my audience to view me as a trusted expert in knowledge.</p>
<h4>Path 1: Leading</h4>
<p>Leadership comes from experience. Aimed at folks behind you on their journey.</p>
<h4>Path 2: Discovering your tribe</h4>
<p>Discover secrets of successful people on behalf of your audience.</p>
<p>Great for people that don't have experience.</p>
<h4>Path 3: Reporting to your tribe</h4>
<p>Requires access to people who are interesting: Uncover ultimate truths by interviewing experts, authorities, and other people in your industry.</p>
<h3>The New &amp; Improved Content Matrix</h3>
<h4>Step 1: Define the outcome</h4>
<p>For me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get email subscribers</li>
<li>Sell products</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 2: Themes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Customer development</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Idea generation</li>
<li>When to pivot</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Targeting</li>
<li>Work/life balance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 3: The styles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Observations</li>
<li>Actionable</li>
<li>Motivational</li>
<li>Analytical</li>
<li>Contrarian</li>
<li>X vs. Y</li>
<li>Present / Future</li>
<li>Listicle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rapid Content Iteration</h3>

<h2>Lesson 4: The Profile Funnel</h2>

-&gt; Read tagline and hashtags<br>
-&gt; Checks Featured sections<br>
-&gt; Reads about<br>
-&gt; Follows</p>

<h2>Lesson 6: Selling on LinkedIn</h2>
<p>Any ask &quot;drains the battery&quot;</p>
<p>Make an ask no more than 90/10 or 80/20</p>
<p>Types of posts:<br>
-&gt; Awareness: Entertaining<br>
-&gt; Information: Teaching things<br>
-&gt; Selling post</p>
<p>Entertaining posts get the most engagement, but least people take action</p>
<p>Information gets lower engagement, but more action</p>
<p>Sell through urgency and FOMO</p>
