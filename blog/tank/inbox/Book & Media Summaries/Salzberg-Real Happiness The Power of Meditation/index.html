<p>On the other hand, if an experience, thought, or feeling is painful, our tendency is to run from it or push it away. For example, if we have physical pain in one part of the body, we might find the rest of our body tightening up, as though to ward off further discomfort. In that way, our aversion to pain adds tension and tightness to the original discomfort. Or maybe we globalize the pain and load it with judgment and recrimination. (This is all my fault. It will never change.) Ironically we might have little direct knowledge of the pain we’re reacting to because we’re scrambling so fast to make it leave, often in ways that make it worse. What we have to understand is that there’s a big difference between pain and suffering. We can have a painful physical experience, but we don’t need to add the suffering of fear or projection into the future or other mental anguish to it. Mindfulness can play a big role in transforming our experience with pain and other difficulties; it allows us to recognize the authenticity of the distress and yet not be overwhelmed by it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003YL4M3S&amp;location=1218">1218</a> ^ref-39532</p>

<p>space. Instead of following your breath, as in the Week One Core Meditation, you’ll let your attention rest fully on the sensation of your feet and legs as you lift them, move them through space, and place them on the ground. Most of the time we have the sense that our consciousness, who we are, resides in our head, somewhere behind our eyes. But in this meditation, we’re going to put our feet in charge. Try to feel your feet not as if you’re looking down at them, but as if they’re looking up at you—as if your consciousness is emanating from the ground up. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003YL4M3S&amp;location=1279">1279</a> ^ref-61998</p>

<p>Choose a brief daily activity—something you may have done thousands of times but never been totally conscious of. This time bring your full awareness to it; pay attention on purpose.
