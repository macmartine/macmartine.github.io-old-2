## Highlights
the most ethereal, uplifting parts of human existence (love, sacrifice, our very sense of moral truth) were products of natural selection. — location: [60](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=60) ^ref-36911

(“Primitive religion” denotes the religion of nonliterate peoples broadly, whether hunter-gatherer or agrarian.) After all, in primitive religion there is deep reverence for raw superstition. Obscure omens often govern decisions of war and peace. — location: [132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=132) ^ref-13888

cultural evolutionism. The idea is that human culture as broadly defined —art, politics, technology, religion, and so on—evolves in much the way biological species evolve: new cultural traits arise and may flourish or perish, and as a result whole institutions and belief systems form and change. — location: [165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=165) ^ref-25357

Animism had been the “infant philosophy of mankind,” assembled by “ancient savage philosophers.” 10 It did what good theories are supposed to do: explain otherwise mysterious facts economically. — location: [177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=177) ^ref-64953

the hypothesis that humans have a ghost-soul handily answers some questions that, in Tylor’s view, must have occurred to early humans, such as: What is happening when you dream? Primitive societies use the notion of the human soul to solve this puzzle. In some cases the idea is that the dreamer’s ghost-soul wanders during sleep, having the adventures the dreamer later recalls; — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=179) ^ref-34513

---
And the idea that the souls of dead people return to visit via dreams is widespread in primitive societies. 13 Thus animism handles another enigma that confronted early human beings: death itself. Death, in this scenario, is what happens when the soul checks out of the body for good. — location: [185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=185) ^ref-16020

---
Once a broadly animistic worldview had taken shape, Tylor believed, it started to evolve. At some point, for example, the notion of each tree having a spirit gave way to the notion of trees being collectively governed by “the god of the forest.” — location: [197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=197) ^ref-6064

---
Evolutionary psychology has shown that, bizarre as some “primitive” beliefs may sound—and bizarre as some “modern” religious beliefs may sound to atheists and agnostics—they are natural outgrowths of humanity, natural products of a brain built by natural selection to make sense of the world with a hodgepodge of tools whose collective output isn’t wholly rational. — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=219) ^ref-58700

there is no such thing as an indigenously monotheistic hunter-gatherer society. — location: [248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=248) ^ref-8722

By Klamath reckoning, the west wind was emitted by a flatulent dwarf woman, about thirty inches tall, who wore a buckskin dress and a basket hat (and who could be seen in the form of a rock on a nearby mountain). The Klamath sometimes asked her to blow mosquitoes away from Pelican Bay. — location: [256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=256) ^ref-23662

Obviously, one thing these gods did for the Klamath is explain the otherwise mysterious workings of nature. — location: [281](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=281) ^ref-42063

---
Every known hunter-gatherer society has similarly explained natural dynamics in supernatural terms—or at least in terms that we consider supernatural; for hunter-gatherers, these invisible beings are seamlessly bound to the observed world of nature, just as, in modern science, the gravitational force is seamlessly bound to the observed, orbiting moon. — location: [283](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=283) ^ref-15757

To them it seems fitting to respond to illness by trying to figure out which god caused it, just as to us it seems fitting to look for the germ that caused it. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=289) ^ref-61892

I think the parts of hunter-gatherer life that we label “religious” are specimens of human culture that, through cultural evolution, were transmuted into modern religion. — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=294) ^ref-4904

hunter-gatherers aren’t the only people to have asked why bad things happen. The Christian tradition alone has generated roomfuls of treatises on this question. But hunter-gatherers do a better job of answering the question than many modern theologians; at least, the hunter-gatherers’ answers are less bedeviled by paradox. Theologians in the Abrahamic lineage —Jewish, Christian, or Islamic—are constrained from the outset by a stiff premise: that reality is governed by an all-knowing, all-powerful, and good God. And why such a god, capable of curing cancer tomorrow, would instead watch innocent people suffer is a conundrum. Just ask Job, who after years of piety was hit by disaster. Unlike most innocent victims, Job was allowed to interrogate God himself about the seeming injustice of it all, yet in the end was forced to settle for this answer: you wouldn’t understand. Numerous theologians have wrestled with this question at book length only to wind up agreeing. — location: [303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=303) ^ref-10893

in hunter-gatherer societies, gods by and large don’t help solve moral problems that would exist in their absence. — location: [351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=351) ^ref-4589

---
Edward Tylor noted in 1874 that the religions of “savage” societies were “almost devoid of that ethical element which to the educated modern mind is the very mainstream of practical religion.” Tylor wasn’t saying that savages lack morality. He stressed that the moral standards of savages are generally “well-defined and praiseworthy.” It’s just that “these ethical laws stand on their own ground of tradition and public opinion,” rather than on a religious foundation. — location: [353](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=353) ^ref-47127

Even if religion is largely about morality today, it doesn’t seem to have started out that way. — location: [367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=367) ^ref-40116

---
There is always an afterlife in hunter-gatherer religion, but it is almost never a carrot or a stick. Often everyone’s spirit winds up in the same eternal home. And in those societies where the land of the dead does have subdivisions, which one you wind up in often has—as some anthropologists have put it—more to do with how you died than with how you lived. — location: [370](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=370) ^ref-43626

Social order can be preserved without deploying the power of religion. — location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=381) ^ref-16995

---
such values as love and generosity and honesty “are not preached nor buttressed by threat of religious reprisal” in these societies, “because they do not need to be.” When modern societies preach these values, they are worried “mostly about morality in the larger society, outside the sphere of kindred and close friends. Primitive people do not have these worries because they do not conceive of—do not have—the larger society to adjust to. The ethic does not extend to strangers; they are simply enemies, not even people.” — location: [390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=390) ^ref-36341

---
hunter-gatherer religions have at least two features that are found, in one sense or another, in all the world’s great religions: they try to explain why bad things happen, and they thus offer a way to make things better. — location: [406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=406) ^ref-51836

good and bad outcomes are under the control of a supernatural being, and the being is subject to influence. — location: [408](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=408) ^ref-34829

It may seem cynical to see all religion as basically self-serving. And indeed the idea has been put pithily by a famous cynic. H. L. Mencken said of religion, “Its single function is to give man access to the powers which seem to control his destiny, and its single purpose is to induce those powers to be friendly to him.… — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=412) ^ref-6925

---
religion has in one sense or another always been about self-interest. Religious doctrines can’t survive if they don’t appeal to the psychology of the people whose brains harbor them, and self-interest is one potent source of appeal. But self-interest can assume many forms, and for that matter it can be aligned, or not aligned, with many other interests: the interest of the family, the interest of the society, the interest of the world, the interest of moral and spiritual truth. Religion almost always forms a link between self-interest and some of those other interests, but which ones it links to, and how, change over time. And over time there has been—on balance, taking the long view—a pattern in the change. Religion has gotten closer to moral and spiritual truth, and for that matter more compatible with scientific truth. Religion hasn’t just evolved; it has matured. One premise of this book is that the story of religion, beginning back in the Stone Age, is to some extent a movement from Mencken to James. — location: [422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=422) ^ref-57553

whenever people sense the presence of a puzzling and momentous force, they want to believe there is a way to comprehend it. If you can convince them that you’re the key to comprehension, you can reach great stature. — location: [441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=441) ^ref-41654

“What is fundamental and universal is the shaman’s struggle against what we could call ‘the powers of evil.’… — location: [470](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=470) ^ref-56228

---
The shaman represents a crucial step in the emergence of organized religion. He (or she, sometimes) is the link between earliest religion—a fluid amalgam of beliefs about a fluid amalgam of spirits—and what religion came to be: a distinct body of belief and practice, kept in shape by an authoritative institution. The shaman is the first step toward an archbishop or an ayatollah. — location: [472](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=472) ^ref-41393

---
Shamanism, in this view, harkens back to a time before industrialization had impeded communion with nature, before church hierarchies had discouraged direct experience of the divine by making themselves official conduits to the sacred. — location: [477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=477) ^ref-40621

Religion, having come from the brains of people, is bound to bear the marks of our species, for better and worse. — location: [486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=486) ^ref-10425

---
Oddly, such declining fortunes can help sustain religious faith. The notion that a shaman’s prowess waxes and wanes allows the society to witness repeated failure without questioning the over-arching idea of shamanic power. It’s eerily like the modern stock market: when a famous stock analyst places a series of bad bets, we say he’s lost his touch and look for an analyst who hasn’t, rather than question the notion that his “touch” was ever anything other than a series of lucky guesses. In modern “secular” societies, as in “primitive” religious ones, faith in expertise is sustained by the timely disposal of experts. — location: [525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=525) ^ref-60621

---
Shamans have often been good at converting their powers into material gain. And they’ve done so whether the powers were benign or malicious. Here is Man on Andamanese shamans: “It is thought that they can bring trouble, sickness, and death upon those who fail to evince their belief in them in some substantial form; they thus generally manage to obtain the best of everything, for it is considered foolhardy to deny them, and they do not scruple to ask for any article to which they may take a fancy.” — location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=533) ^ref-30302

---
So here is the pattern: in pre-agricultural societies around the world, people have profited, in one sense or another, by cultivating a reputation for special access to the supernatural. 38 It’s enough to make you wonder: Might they, in the course of establishing their bona fides, sometimes resort to deceit? Was the average shaman a fraud—or, as one anthropologist put it, a “pious fraud”? — location: [566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=566) ^ref-62904

There are deeply religious Christian ministers who urge the congregation to pray for the ill, even though they personally doubt that God uses opinion polls to decide who lives and who dies. — location: [613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=613) ^ref-8826

in the appendix of this book, evolutionary psychology is used to explain the very origins of religious belief as the residue of built-in distortions of perception and cognition; natural selection didn’t design us to believe only true things, so we’re susceptible to certain kinds of falsehood. — location: [630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=630) ^ref-13268

our normal states of consciousness are in a sense arbitrary; they are the states that happen to have served the peculiar agenda of mundane natural selection. — location: [632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=632) ^ref-26220

William James, in The Varieties of Religious Experience, explored the influence on consciousness of things ranging from meditation to nitrous oxide and concluded that “our normal waking consciousness” is “but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.” 58 James’s position in the book—that these alternative forms may be in some sense more truthful than ordinary consciousness —is the properly open-minded stance, and it has if anything been strengthened by evolutionary psychology. — location: [639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=639) ^ref-55282

---
The shaman’s role in cultivating antipathy and violence, both within the society and beyond it, is more evidence against the romantic view of religion as fallen—having been born pure only to be corrupted later. Apparently one of religion’s most infamous modern roles, fomenter of conflict between societies, was part of the story from very near the beginning. — location: [681](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=681) ^ref-9289

---
So, all told, was religion in the age of the shaman more a force for good or for ill? There are two main schools of thought on this question. The “functionalists” see religion as serving the interests of the society as a whole. Thus the seminal French sociologist Emile Durkheim could find virtue in religion under even the most challenging conditions. Some observers, for example, have been hard pressed to explain what social good is being done by the Australian aborigines’ violent mourning rituals, during which women used digging sticks to slash their heads and men with stone knives cut the muscles of their thighs so deeply that they fell down, immobilized. 70 For Durkheim this was not a problem. In Elementary Forms of Religious Life he wrote that weeping together not only helped the people withstand the trauma of recent death, but actually made them collectively stronger. For “every communion of mind, in whatever form it may be made, raises the social vitality. The exceptional violence of the manifestations by which the common pain is necessarily and obligatorily expressed even testifies to the fact that at this moment, the society is more alive and active than ever.” 71 Opposed to the functionalists is a group you might call the cynics, or perhaps the “Marxists”—not because they’re communists, but because, like Marx, they think that social structures, including shared beliefs, tend to serve the powerful. The anthropologist Paul Radin, in his 1937 book Primitive Religion, depicted Eskimo shamanism as serving a single interest group: Eskimo shamans. Their “complex religious theory” and “spectacular shamanistic technique” are “designed to do two things: to keep the contact with the supernatural exclusively in the hands of the angakok [shaman], and to manipulate and exploit the sense of fear of the ordinary man.” — location: [684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=684) ^ref-4616

---
Marx’s view of hunter-gatherer life was too simple. Granted, a small society that lives barely above the subsistence level is more egalitarian than a modern industrial society, which can muster massive disparities between the wealthiest and the poorest. But it’s hard to claim there are no differentials of power, and no exploitation of power, in a society where shamans amass gifts by instilling irrational fear, or a society in which shamans convince women that the way to please the gods is to have sex with shamans. Still, Marx was onto something: since social structure changes over time, and religion is at least in part a reflection of social structure, the virtues of religion may change in a patterned way as cultural evolution changes that structure. — location: [708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=708) ^ref-5505

---
Chiefdoms are typically agricultural societies, and they are much bigger and more elaborate than the average hunter-gatherer society, usually comprising many villages and thousands of people. — location: [738](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=738) ^ref-61688

---
The chiefdom level of social organization seems to have been a standard way station between hunter-gatherer societies and the early ancient states, such as Egypt and Shang China—bigger, urban polities that had writing. The chiefdom, the most advanced form of social organization in the world 7,000 years ago, represents the final prehistoric phase in the evolution of social organization, and the evolution of religion. There are lots of differences among observed chiefdoms, but one thing they share is structural reliance on the supernatural. Their political and religious systems are deeply intertwined; their rulers have a special connection to the divine and put this status to political use. The Polynesian chief, one western scholar wrote, “stands to the people as a god.” — location: [742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=742) ^ref-64508

---
Though the shaman’s claims to supernatural skill earned him or her social status and a kind of power over people’s lives, shamanic influence rarely translated into clear-cut political clout. But as agriculture emerged and chiefdoms crystallized, political and religious leadership matured and fused, and the fusion held these newly complex societies together. — location: [749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=749) ^ref-43723

---
Some anthropologists call these kinds of gods “departmental gods,” and one reason there were so many of them in Polynesia is that there were so many departments. Whereas everyone in a hunter-gatherer society is a hunter and/or gatherer, the evolution of chiefdoms meant real division of labor, and gods multiplied to fill the new vocational niches. — location: [777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=777) ^ref-38431

---
Tapu violations were punished by the gods themselves, in the form of a fishless expedition, an illness, even death. — location: [817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=817) ^ref-42067

---
The second key concept was mana. Scholars disagree on what mana meant—in part, no doubt, because its meaning varied subtly from chiefdom to chiefdom. Some say mana was a magical or divine power, a kind of supernatural electricity. Others say mana was more mundane; it was basically just efficacy, — location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=819) ^ref-57572

---
As if all this weren’t enough, chiefs were often descended from gods—and upon death might well become gods themselves, assuming they weren’t already considered divine. — location: [834](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=834) ^ref-27643

Polynesian political leaders were drenched in authority that emanated from the divine. — location: [837](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=837) ^ref-14757

“These people blindly obey the least wish of their great Chief. They look upon him as an absolute master, not only of their property but also of their lives.” — location: [843](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=843) ^ref-47913

---
This sort of laissez-faire law enforcement is a shakier source of social order in chiefdoms than in hunter-gatherer societies. In a small hunter-gatherer village, you know everyone and see them often and may someday need their help. So the costs of getting on someone’s bad side are high and the temptation to offend them commensurately low. In a chiefdom, containing thousands or even tens of thousands of people, some of your neighbors are more remote, hence more inviting targets of exploitation. — location: [867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=867) ^ref-38859

---
When you add up all the little ways Polynesian religion encouraged self-restraint, 44 you wind up with a fair amount of encouragement—enough, perhaps, to compensate for the absence of a centralized legal system. And religion in chiefdoms was doing more than fill in for not-yet-invented secular laws; it was paving the way for secular laws. — location: [915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=915) ^ref-21933

In chiefdoms, gods were guardians of political power, supervisors of economic performance, and supporters of social norms that let unprecedently large numbers of people live together. — location: [938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=938) ^ref-54798

---
In chiefdoms powerful men get many wives, whereas in modern societies they get (if they want) many mistresses. In chiefdoms the powerful could do things that if done by others would be grave offenses, whereas in modern societies the same privilege is granted less formally; the rich and powerful use pricey lawyers and key contacts to dodge justice while poorer offenders go to jail. — location: [991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=991) ^ref-37017

Providing this sort of comfort is a time-honored way for religious doctrine to thrive, but as cultural evolution proceeds, the things that people find comforting change. — location: [1067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=1067) ^ref-29262

Modern science, like modern economics and modern law and modern government, evolved from primordial forms that were symbiotically intertwined with religious thought. In fact, it isn’t obvious that we would have any of these modern institutions had it not been for early religion, which did so much to carry human social organization and culture beyond the hunter-gatherer stage. — location: [1087](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=1087) ^ref-55777

the now familiar profile of western religion had appeared: belief in only one god, a fundamentally good god who focuses on the moral improvement of human beings, not the gratification of his own desires, and who cares about all people everywhere.

The pantheon of an ancient state typically included lots of nature gods (sun, moon, storm, fertility, and so on) and gods that oversaw the ever-growing array of vocations, in particular gods for farmers, scribes, merchants, and craftsmen. Mesopotamia had gods for everything from brickmaking to brewing, and in Aztec society robbers claimed their own deity. — location: [1184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=1184) ^ref-54618

concede that ancient religion was largely in the service of political and economic power, then look at how changes in the structure of power, over the millennia, reshaped religious doctrine. In some ways that change was for the better. In fact, this tethering of divine logic to the terrestrial logic of politics and economics helped push religion toward moral enlightenment. It is the main reason for that crucial synergy between ethics and universalism—the main reason that the circle of moral consideration has expanded over time, beyond the bounds of tribe and race. — location: [1232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002AKPEHW&location=1232) ^ref-1897
