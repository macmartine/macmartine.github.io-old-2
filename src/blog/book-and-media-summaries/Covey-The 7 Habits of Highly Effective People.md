## Highlights
On a ten-point scale, if I am at level two in any field, and desire to move to level five, I must first take the step toward level three. “A thousand-mile journey begins with the first step” and can only be taken one step at a time. — location: [1021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1021) ^ref-52437

To relate effectively with a wife, a husband, children, friends, or working associates, we must learn to listen. And this requires emotional strength. Listening involves patience, openness, and the desire to understand—highly developed qualities of character. — location: [1031](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1031) ^ref-64268

I remember violating this principle myself as a father many years ago. One day I returned home to my little girl’s third-year birthday party to find her in the corner of the front room, defiantly clutching all of her presents, unwilling to let the other children play with them. The first thing I noticed was several parents in the room witnessing this selfish display. I was embarrassed, and doubly so because at the time I was teaching university classes in human relations. And I knew, or at least felt, the expectation of these parents. The atmosphere in the room was really charged—the children were crowding around my little daughter with their hands out, asking to play with the presents they had just given, and my daughter was adamantly refusing. I said to myself, “Certainly I should teach my daughter to share. The value of sharing is one of the most basic things we believe in.” So I first tried a simple request. “Honey, would you please share with your friends the toys they’ve given you?” “No,” she replied flatly. My second method was to use a little reasoning. “Honey, if you learn to share your toys with them when they are at your home, then when you go to their homes they will share their toys with you.” Again, the immediate reply was “No!” I was becoming a little more embarrassed, for it was evident I was having no influence. The third method was bribery. Very softly I said, “Honey, if you share, I’ve got a special surprise for you. I’ll give you a piece of gum.” “I don’t want gum!” she exploded. Now I was becoming exasperated. For my fourth attempt, I resorted to fear and threat. “Unless you share, you will be in real trouble!” “I don’t care!” she cried. “These are my things. I don’t have to share!” Finally, I resorted to force. I merely took some of the toys and gave them to the other kids. “Here, kids, play with these.” Perhaps my daughter needed the experience of possessing the things before she could give them. (In fact, unless I possess something, can I ever really give it?) She needed me as her father to have a higher level of emotional maturity to give her that experience. But at that moment, I valued the opinion those parents had of me more than the growth and development of my child and our relationship together. I simply made an initial judgment that I was right; she should share, and she was wrong in not doing so. Perhaps I superimposed a higher-level expectation on her simply because on my own scale I was at a lower level. I was unable or unwilling to give patience or understanding, so I expected her to give things. In an attempt to compensate for my deficiency, I borrowed strength from my position and authority and forced her to do what I wanted her to do. But borrowing strength builds weakness. It builds weakness in the borrower because it reinforces dependence on external factors to get things done. It builds weakness in the person forced to acquiesce, stunting the development of independent reasoning, growth, and internal… — location: [1043](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1043) ^ref-64184

I’ve learned that once children gain a sense of real possession, they share very naturally, freely, and spontaneously. — location: [1073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1073) ^ref-35698

But to take the child alone, quietly, when the relationship is good and to discuss the teaching or the value seems to have much greater impact. — location: [1076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1076) ^ref-29480

Is getting more things done in less time going to make a difference—or will it just increase the pace at which I react to the people and circumstances that seem to control my life? — location: [1107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1107) ^ref-39007

Albert Einstein observed, “The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.” — location: [1124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1124) ^ref-61843

It says if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it. If you want to have a more pleasant, cooperative teenager, be a more understanding, empathic, consistent, loving parent. If you want to have more freedom, more latitude in your job, be a more responsible, a more helpful, a more contributing employee. If you want to be trusted, be trustworthy. If you want the secondary greatness of recognized talent, focus first on primary greatness of character. — location: [1132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1132) ^ref-7449

But knowing I need to listen and knowing how to listen is not enough. Unless I want to listen, unless I have the desire, it won’t be a habit in my life. Creating a habit requires work in all three dimensions. — location: [1188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1188) ^ref-51354

Happiness can be defined, in part at least, as the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventually. — location: [1194](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1194) ^ref-23037

If you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs and neglects the goose, you will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs. On the other hand, if you only take care of the goose with no aim toward the golden eggs, you soon won’t have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the goose. — location: [1280](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1280) ^ref-2282

Effectiveness lies in the balance—what I call the P/PC Balance. P stands for production of desired results, the golden eggs. PC stands for production capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs. — location: [1282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1282) ^ref-16598

Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn. — location: [1296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1296) ^ref-7582

When two people in a marriage are more concerned about getting the golden eggs, the benefits, than they are in preserving the relationship that makes them possible, they often become insensitive and inconsiderate, neglecting the little kindnesses and courtesies so important to a deep relationship. They begin to use control levers to manipulate each other, to focus on their own needs, to justify their own position and look for evidence to show the wrongness of the other person. The love, the richness, the softness and spontaneity begin to deteriorate. The goose gets sicker day by day. — location: [1300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1300) ^ref-24425

The PC principle is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to treat your best customers. — location: [1355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1355) ^ref-13177

In fact, until we take how we see ourselves (and how we see others) into account, we will be unable to understand how others see and feel about themselves and their world. Unaware, we will project our intentions on their behavior and call ourselves objective. — location: [1449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1449) ^ref-35806

Even the most intelligent animals have none of these endowments. To use a computer metaphor, they are programmed by instinct and/or training. They can be trained to be responsible, but they can’t take responsibility for that training; in other words, they can’t direct it. They can’t change the programming. They’re not even aware of it. But because of our unique human endowments, we can write new programs for ourselves totally apart from our instincts and training. This is why an animal’s capacity is relatively limited and man’s is unlimited. But if we live like animals, out of our own instincts and conditioning and conditions, out of our collective memory, we too will be limited. — location: [1504](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1504) ^ref-45646

In making such a choice, we become reactive. Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn’t, it affects their attitude and their performance. Proactive people can carry their own weather with them. Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to them. They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good quality work, it isn’t a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not. — location: [1525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1525) ^ref-41729

As Eleanor Roosevelt observed, “No one can hurt you without your consent.” In the words of Gandhi, “They cannot take away our self respect if we do not give it to them.” — location: [1535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1535) ^ref-784

It is our willing permission, our consent to what happens to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the first place. — location: [1536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1536) ^ref-15325

But until a person can say deeply and honestly, “I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday,” that person cannot say, “I choose otherwise.” — location: [1538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1538) ^ref-24650

---
It’s not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hurts us. Of course, things can hurt us physically or economically and can cause sorrow. But our character, our basic identity, does not have to be hurt at all. — location: [1556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1556) ^ref-12905

In fact, our most difficult experiences become the crucibles that forge our character and develop the internal powers, the freedom to handle difficult circumstances in the future and to inspire others to do so as well. — location: [1557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=1557) ^ref-48576

A PERSONAL MISSION STATEMENT — location: [2070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=2070) ^ref-52743

---
That subordination requires a purpose, a mission, a Habit 2 clear sense of direction and value, a burning “yes!” inside that makes it possible to say “no” to other things. It also requires independent will, the power to do something when you don’t want to do it, to be a function of your values rather than a function of the impulse or desire of any given moment. It’s the power to act with integrity to your proactive first creation. — location: [2753](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=2753) ^ref-56133

But there is an emerging fourth generation that is different in kind. It recognizes that “time management” is really a misnomer—the challenge is not to manage time, but to manage ourselves. Satisfaction is a function of expectation as well as realization. And expectation (and satisfaction) lie in our Circle of Influence. — location: [2779](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=2779) ^ref-4525

So I recommend reading literature, such as the inspiring biography of Anwar Sadat, In Search of Identity, and seeing movies like Chariots of Fire or plays like Les Misérables that expose you to models of Win/Win. — location: [3882](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=3882) ^ref-41967

When you’re dealing with a person who is coming from a paradigm of Win/Lose, the relationship is still the key. The place to focus is on your Circle of Influence. You make deposits into the Emotional Bank Account through genuine courtesy, respect, and appreciation for that person and for the other point of view. You stay longer in the communication process. You listen more, you listen in greater depth. You express yourself with greater courage. You aren’t reactive. You go deeper inside yourself for strength of character to be proactive. You keep hammering it out until the other person begins to realize that you genuinely want the resolution to be a real win for both of you. That very process is a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account. — location: [3902](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=3902) ^ref-39479

If all the air were suddenly sucked out of the room you’re in right now, what would happen to your interest in this book? You wouldn’t care about the book; you wouldn’t care about anything except getting air. Survival would be your only motivation. But now that you have air, it doesn’t motivate you. This is one of the greatest insights in the field of human motivation: Satisfied needs do not motivate. It’s only the unsatisfied need that motivates. Next to physical survival, the greatest need of a human being is psychological survival—to be understood, to be affirmed, to be validated, to be appreciated. When you listen with empathy to another person, you give that person psychological air. And after that vital need is met, you can then focus on influencing or problem solving. — location: [4244](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00GOZV3TM&location=4244) ^ref-61389
