## Finding meaning

> In short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. And it seems almost ridiculous to say that a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life— the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual.

from <a href='https://fs.blog/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/' target='_blank'>Hunter S. Thompson’s Letter on Finding Your Purpose and Living a Meaningful Life</a>

One of the best pieces I've ever read on intentional living. I read this a couple times a year.

## Watch

It's the weekend, and a good time to watch <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F__DQ1ruYck' target='_blank'>Dealt</a>, a moving and inspirational story about a man named Richard Turner, who, when finding out his was going blind as a child, became obsessed with cards, and went on to becoming one of the world's greatest card magicians despite losing his eyesight.
