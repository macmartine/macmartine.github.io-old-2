don’t think life is that hard. I think we make it hard.

Doing something because you “should” basically means you don’t actually want to do it. It’s just making you miserable, so I’m trying to eliminate as many “shoulds” from my life as possible. [1] — location: [1358](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08FF8MTM6&location=1358) ^ref-41458
