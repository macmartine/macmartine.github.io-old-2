## Highlights
That’s right! I’m about to jump out of an airplane that’s 18,000 feet above the Earth! That’s, like, the highest you can get before you’re legally in — location: [23](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08L2YKVCQ&location=23) ^ref-44179

Like, you could tell that they put a lot of work into them. If any of them won that raygun, then I wouldn’t be surprised, like, AT ALL.

But then he just stopped in the middle of traffic so he could figure out where to go, which made us TOTALLY look like a bunch of lost tourists. — location: [262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08L2YKVCQ&location=262) ^ref-41807
