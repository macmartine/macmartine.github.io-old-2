We all want to [raise our prices](/blog/posts/20230213172129.md) as high as we can get away with.

But if we're just getting our product off the ground, we also need our initial stream of customers.

This can make us feel conflicted, because we want both, yet we're afraid that if our prices are high, it'll create friction in getting our prospects to buy. And this is true.

Yet, these approaches can be very powerful when combined. 

We begin with the end in mind.

We do this by preparing an offer where we provide as much value as we can given all the problems out customers may have. The higher the sum of the value of the problems we are able solve for them, the higher the price can be. The price itself doesn't matter, as long as the value provided is a multiple of that.

From there we can implement "free or cheap", to get our initial wave of customers in the door. If we are already providing immense value for the price we aim to charge, we can initially start even lower, and make it clear that the price will be rising, which in turn adds urgency to the offer.

The result is an offer than prospects simply can't refuse. Use this to get a good wave of momentum, word-of-mouth referrals, and an initial stream of revenue. From there you are well-positioned to start inching towards your pricing target.

iPhone did a great job of this. It's a phone, a camera, a computer in your pocket.
