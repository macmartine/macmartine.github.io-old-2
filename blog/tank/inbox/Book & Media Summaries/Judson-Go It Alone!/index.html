<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>We’ve already discussed three of these: personal leverage, extreme outsourcing, and relentless repeatability, that enable founders to focus on what they do best. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=249">249</a> ^ref-2277</p>

<p>In general, today’s successful entrepreneurs are a surprising mix of prudence and courage: They aren’t afraid to try new things, but they first do everything they can to reduce all costs and risks. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=259">259</a> ^ref-55874</p>
<hr>
<p>They may take a risk on a new business model or a concept that has not been tried before — and they are not afraid of risk, but within that framework, they do everything they can to limit the costs of failure.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=268">268</a> ^ref-60145</p>

<p>“The path to success involves staying a little ahead of the competition but close enough that customers can understand your product and incorporate it into their lives and businesses.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=316">316</a> ^ref-28594</p>

<p>“Years of research shows that the innovations most likely to take hold are those that don’t demand excessive change from the customer.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=318">318</a> ^ref-32099</p>
<hr>
<p>The lesson, again, is that to survive and thrive, go-it-alone entrepreneurs must build a paying customer base quickly. To do this, successful entrepreneurs focus on starting businesses that don’t require dramatic shifts in the behavior of customers, suppliers, or service providers. Though such businesses may turn out to be revolutionary change agents, they typically start out as evolutionary improvements with a value that customers can see immediately. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=338">338</a> ^ref-18785</p>

<p>Go-it-alone entrepreneurs achieve long-term success in part through an ongoing commitment to continuous low-cost innovation and to flexible business systems. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=345">345</a> ^ref-21507</p>

<p>In a compendium of his work titled The Essential Drucker, he writes that “when a new venture does succeed, more often than not it is in a market other than the one it was originally intended to serve, with products or services not quite those with which it had set out, bought in large part by customers it did not even think of when it started.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=349">349</a> ^ref-34436</p>

<p>“Rather than dismiss the unexpected as an ‘exception,’ as entrepreneurs are inclined to do, they need to go out and look at it carefully and as a distinct opportunity.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=356">356</a> ^ref-39002</p>

<p>Moreover, successful go-it-alone entrepreneurs have figured out how to test and launch new products and services quickly and at minimal cost. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=376">376</a> ^ref-59115</p>

<p>The mantra for each of the businesses discussed above could easily be the same: They develop a quick, inexpensive process for discovering what new products and services potential customers will buy. The benefits here are threefold: (1) They rarely waste precious dollars on failed launches, (2) They limit the time they devote to any unsuccessful initiative, and (3) They view their business as a constantly evolving, flexible system that can maintain its competitive edge. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=404">404</a> ^ref-14672</p>

<p>Just as you want to design your business with the flexibility to shift your product mix, you also want to be constantly operating live tests of potential improvements in your core business. For me, this means that at any one moment I am conducting somewhere between 5 and 10 different tests of how services are marketed on the Web. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=427">427</a> ^ref-48170</p>

<p>“If you’re an entrepreneur, you’re going to break new ground. A lot of people are going to say it’s not possible. You can’t accept that too easily.

<p>entrepreneurs. If you are working hard and not realizing your objectives, you either are trying to do too much or haven’t established the appropriate systems to leverage your core skills. In either case, the answer is not to keep slogging on; it is to rethink your systems. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=689">689</a> ^ref-19154</p>

<p>the Rule of Decreasing Support Costs: Services that are available today at high expense for large businesses will be available in 12 to 18 months on a plug-and-play outsourced basis to small companies at low monthly usage fees. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=808">808</a> ^ref-62997</p>

<p>To the user, the cost savings from relying on an ASP are similar to those from traveling as one of many airline passengers instead of chartering a private jet for personal use. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=834">834</a> ^ref-64985</p>

<p>The solutions to problems individuals face in their own lives.

<p>“Companies often get started by people who develop a product for themselves or their close friends. It’s almost accidental that their product becomes something that millions of other people want. Almost all of our best investments have sprung from this personal impulse.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=1227">1227</a> ^ref-60614</p>

<p>Most new products or services are, in reality, incremental improvements on existing ones. In considering this option, there are two important questions to keep in mind: First, put yourself in the place of your target customers. Is your potential new product or service sufficiently better, either in the features it offers or the cost involved, so that customers will shift to your offering from whatever they are using today? Second, what happens to your proposed business if existing participants in this arena quickly match your improvement in response to the threat of your offering? It’s a tremendous plus for your business opportunity if you have a valid reason to believe this type of fast competitive response is unlikely, or impossible, in the business area you are assessing. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC2KJW&amp;location=1254">1254</a> ^ref-6054</p>
