## Highlights
In particular, the winners invent and live by a process of customer learning and discovery. I call this process “Customer Development,” a sibling to “Product Development,” and each and every startup that succeeds recapitulates it, knowingly or not. — location: [67](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=67) ^ref-53998

Given that the Product Development model is used by almost every organization launching a new product, asking what’s wrong with it might seem as heretical as asking “What’s wrong with breathing?” — location: [201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=201) ^ref-62097

---
The first hint lies in its name. The Product Development model is not a marketing, sales hiring, customer acquisition, or even a financing model. Yet startup companies have traditionally used a Product Development model to manage and pace all these non-engineering activities. In fact, there are 10 major flaws to using the Product Development model in a startup. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=203) ^ref-49053

---
The greatest risk—and hence the greatest cause of failure—in startups is not in the development of the new product but in the development of customers and markets. Startups don’t fail because they lack a product; they fail because they lack customers and a proven financial model. — location: [207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=207) ^ref-40905

---
The Product Development model is so focused on building and shipping the product that makes the fundamental and fatal error of ignoring the process I call Customer Discovery. — location: [222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=222) ^ref-2086

---
In startups the emphasis is on “get it done, and get it done fast.” So it’s natural that heads of Sales and Marketing believe they are hired for what they know, not what they can learn. — location: [238](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=238) ^ref-52349

---
Before we can build and sell a product, we have to answer some very basic questions: What are the problems our product solves? Do customers perceive these problems as important or “must-have”? If we’re selling to businesses, who in a company has a problem our product could solve? If we are selling to consumers how do we reach them? How big is this problem? Who do we make the first sales call on? Who else has to approve the purchase? How many customers do we need to be profitable? What’s the average order size? — location: [242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=242) ^ref-26729

---
Others focus on acquiring early “lighthouse” customers (prominent customers who will attract others). — location: [271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=271) ^ref-9736

---
Simply put, a startup should focus on reaching a deep understanding of customers and their problems, their pains, and the jobs they need done discovering a repeatable roadmap of how they buy, and building a financial model that results in profitability. — location: [274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=274) ^ref-37762

---
The appropriate milestones measuring a startup’s progress answer these questions: How well do we understand what problems customers have? How much will they pay to solve those problems? Do our product features solve these problems? Do we understand our customers’ business? Do we understand the hierarchy of customer needs? Have we found visionary customers, ones who will buy our product early? Is our product a must-have for these customers? Do we understand the sales roadmap well enough to consistently sell the product? Do we understand what we need to be profitable? Are the sales and business plans realistic, scalable, and achievable? What do we do if our model turns out to be wrong? — location: [276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=276) ^ref-54547

One of the radical insights guiding this book is that startups fall into one of four basic categories: Bringing a new product into an existing market Bringing a new product into a new market Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a low-cost entrant Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a niche entrant — location: [391](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=391) ^ref-2548

---
Here’s the point: Since the four types of startups have very different rates of customer adoption and acceptance, their sales and marketing strategies differ dramatically. Even more serious, each Market Type has radically different cash needs. A company creating a new market might be unprofitable for five or more years, while one in an existing market might generate cash in 12-18 months. As a result, the Product Development model is not only useless, it is dangerous. — location: [404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=404) ^ref-10364

---
The sad reality is if you don’t get the first part of early Customer Development right, you won’t be in the mainstream. — location: [449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=449) ^ref-49929

---
Second, the curve invites us to think of technology enthusiasts as one part of the customer adoption curve. On the curve they look like just an early set of customers, but in reality they are not. Technology enthusiasts exist as one of those sales puzzles on the path to finding “real” paying early customers and a repeatable sales process. You need to deal with them and understand their influence in the sales roadmap, but they very rarely buy anything. — location: [450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=450) ^ref-62625

---
In the early stages of a startup, focusing on “execution” will put you out of business. Instead, you need a “learning and discovery” process so you can get the company to the point where you know what to execute. — location: [459](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=459) ^ref-58737

---
Startups use a Product Development methodology to measure the progress of their development team, control their cash-burn rate and time their product launch. Yet we don’t think twice when we hire the best marketing, sales, and business development talent, toss them into a startup and say, “Go figure out who wants to buy this, and quickly sell a whole bunch. Let us know when you are done, but keep it vague and wave your hands a lot when we ask you how much progress you are making.” Seems silly doesn’t it? Yet that’s the state of the startup today. — location: [467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=467) ^ref-52605

---
Learning and discovering who a company’s initial customers will be, and what markets they are in, requires a separate and distinct process from Product Development. — location: [473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=473) ^ref-11775

The goal of Customer Discovery is just what the name implies: finding out who the customers for your product are and whether the problem you believe you are solving is important to them. — location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=584) ^ref-24652

---
Customer Validation is where the rubber meets the road. The goal of this step is to build a repeatable sales roadmap for the sales and marketing teams that will follow later. The sales roadmap is the playbook of the proven and repeatable sales process that has been field-tested by successfully selling the product to early customers. — location: [607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=607) ^ref-27794

---
In fact, competitors define the market. The basis of competition is therefore all about the product and product features. — location: [685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=685) ^ref-11758

---
You can enter an existing market with a cheaper or repositioned “niche” product, but if that is the case we call it a resegmented market. — location: [686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=686) ^ref-29499

---
In contrast, most startups can only guess who their customers are and what markets they are in. The only certainty on day one is the product vision. It follows, then, the goal of Customer Development in a startup is to find a market for the product as spec’d, not to develop or refine a spec based on a market that is unknown. This is a fundamental difference between a big company and most startups. Put another way, big companies tailor their Product Development to known customers. — location: [748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=748) ^ref-44894

---
As the market and customers get clearer by successive refinement, product features are driven by how well they satisfy this market. In short, in big companies, the product spec is market-driven; in startups, the marketing is product-driven. — location: [754](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=754) ^ref-60652

---
Have we identified a problem a customer wants solved? Does our product solve these customer needs? If so, do we have a viable and profitable business model? Have we learned enough to go out and sell? Answering these questions is the purpose of the first step in the Customer Development model, Customer Discovery. This chapter explains how to go about it. — location: [822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=822) ^ref-63729

---
In a traditional product management and marketing process the goal is to develop a Marketing Requirements Document (MRD) for engineering. The MRD contains the sum of all the possible customer feature requests, prioritized in a collaborative effort among Marketing, Sales and Engineering. — location: [845](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=845) ^ref-32585

---
While this process is rational for an established company entering an existing market, it is folly for startups. — location: [849](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=849) ^ref-8453

out the same hierarchy of needs. Earlyvangelists can be identified by these customer characteristics (see Figure 3.1): — location: [885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=885) ^ref-59172

---
Earlyvangelist Characteristics — location: [890](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=890) ^ref-32082

---
On the day the company starts, there is very limited customer input to a product specification. The company doesn’t know who its initial customers are (but it may think it knows) or what they will want as features. One alternative is to put Product Development on hold until the Customer Development team can find those customers. However, having a product you can demonstrate and iterate is helpful in moving the Customer Development process along. A more productive approach is to proceed with Product Development, with the feature list driven by the vision and experience of the company’s founders. — location: [900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=900) ^ref-43849

---
Therefore, the Customer Development model has your founding team take the product as spec’d and search to see if there are customers—any customers—who will buy the product exactly as you have defined it. When you find those customers, you tailor the first release of the product so it satisfies their needs. The shift in thinking is important. For the first product in a startup, your initial purpose in meeting customers is not to gather feature requests so you can change the product; it is to find customers for the product you are already building. — location: [904](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=904) ^ref-63427

---
If, and only if, no customers can be found for the product as spec’d do you bring the features customers requested to the Product Development team. — location: [908](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=908) ^ref-26806

---
To sum up the Customer Discovery philosophy: In sharp contrast to the MRD approach of building a product for a wide group of customers, a successful startup’s first release is designed to be “good enough only for our first paying customers.” — location: [920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=920) ^ref-41426

---
The Product Development process emphasizes execution. The Customer Development process emphasizes learning, discovery, failure, iterations and pivots. — location: [983](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=983) ^ref-64962

---
For this reason you want to ensure there is enough funding for two to three passes through the Customer Discovery and Customer Validation steps. — location: [984](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=984) ^ref-64626

---
You also want to articulate in writing both the business and product vision of why you started the company. — location: [988](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=988) ^ref-65319

Finally, next to the mission statement post the founding team’s core values. — location: [995](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=995) ^ref-4656

The first step in formulating your customer brief is to write down and diagram who you think will be your day-to-day users, influencers, recommenders, economic buyer, and decision-maker, including, in the case of sales to companies, their titles and where in the organization they are found. — location: [1108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1108) ^ref-36116

In the Customer Creation step your marketing programs will promise consumers their unneeded spending will be worth it. — location: [1120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1120) ^ref-13811

---
Describe how you can convince these customers that your product can deliver an emotional payoff. — location: [1122](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1122) ^ref-57917

have. In this customer problem brief, you use a simple “problem recognition scale” for each type of customer (user, influencer, recommender, economic buyer, decision-maker). — location: [1144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1144) ^ref-18384

---
The next part of the customer problem brief expresses this understanding in the form of “a day in the life of a customer.” — location: [1161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1161) ^ref-23811

---
Once you have the organizational map, the next step is to understand the relationships among the recommenders, influencers, economic buyers, and saboteurs. How do you think a sale will be made? Who must be convinced (and in what order) for you and your company to make a sale? This is the beginning of your customer influence map. — location: [1188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1188) ^ref-32410

---
Start by making a list of 50 potential customers you can test your ideas on. Fifty names sounds like a lot of leads, but as you’ll soon see, you’ll go through them quickly. Where do you get these names? From your social networks, friends, investors, founders, lawyers, recruiters, trade magazines, business reference books, accountants, and any other source you can think of. — location: [1409](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1409) ^ref-35720

---
At this stage, you are less interested in big names and titles or the “exact right” consumers. You are interested in individuals who will give you some of their time and who you think even loosely fit the profile embedded in your customer hypotheses. — location: [1414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1414) ^ref-56022

---
Keep in mind the goal of this initial flurry of calling is not only to meet with people whose names you collect but also to use these customer contacts to network your way up “the food-chain of expertise.” — location: [1422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1422) ^ref-58611

---
The first step in this phase is the hardest—contacting potential customers who don’t know you and convincing them to give you some of their time. But this step gets a lot easier if you do two things: (1) get a referral and (2) carefully prepare a reference story that gets you in the door. — location: [1425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1425) ^ref-12780

---
The best introduction to a prospect, when you can manage it, is through a peer within his or her company. — location: [1429](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1429) ^ref-17456

---
First, create an introductory email. Include a one-paragraph description of your company, a general description of what you are doing, and a statement of what’s in it for your contact to spend time with you. No, you aren’t going to send cold email; the people who gave you the leads are. Forward your email to them and ask them to send it on to the contact they gave you. — location: [1432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1432) ^ref-26025

---
To make this work, you and your co-founders need to make 10 (yes, 10) phone calls a day. — location: [1448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00FLZKNUQ&location=1448) ^ref-46796
