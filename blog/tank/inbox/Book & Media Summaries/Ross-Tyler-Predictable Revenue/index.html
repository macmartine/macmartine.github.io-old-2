<p>People tend to do more of what is not working rather than stepping back, taking a breather, and trying to figure out a new approach. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=283">283</a> ^ref-52707</p>

<p>Start with more awareness on how much pipeline you're generating: Do your executive team and board know how much new (qualified) pipeline the company needs to generate per month? (This is the #2 most important metric to track, right after closed business.) — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=299">299</a> ^ref-50600</p>

<p>Mass emailing C-level Fortune 5000 executives, with specific kinds of emails, can generate 9%+ response rates. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=436">436</a> ^ref-25403</p>

<p>The tipping point of the Cold Calling 2.0 process was born: sending mass emails to high level executives to ask for referrals to the best person in their organization for a first conversation. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=440">440</a> ^ref-35507</p>

<p>Making the field salespeople do cold calls means having your highest-cost (per hour) sales resource perform the lowest-value (per hour) activity. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=492">492</a> ^ref-58287</p>

<p>Spend serious time on identifying and clarifying your Ideal Customer Profile. Define what companies are the most similar to your top 5-10% of your customers, defined as the ones likeliest to purchase for the most revenue, and develop focused target lists based on these tight criteria. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=526">526</a> ^ref-6943</p>
<hr>
<p>Send emails that are very short (readable on a blackberry) and to the point. Be honest and to the point—what are you looking for? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=531">531</a> ^ref-15156</p>

<p>The point is to focus your highest value people on the low-volume but high-value activities — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=557">557</a> ^ref-59432</p>

<p>Email response rates (usually 7-10%) What e-mails are companies responding to, and why Who is responding (title, position of authority) Number of Scoping Calls completed Who became a qualified opportunity, and why Refinements to the Ideal Customer Profile (which was revised many, many times) — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=587">587</a> ^ref-8693</p>
<hr>
<p>The roles are very different (inbound reps receive leads to work to qualify, while outbound reps initiate calls and emails), and it’s very challenging for a rep to switch between the two mindsets throughout the day. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=641">641</a> ^ref-31994</p>

<p>Here is the source your PREDICTABLE REVENUE comes from: predictable lead generation. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=662">662</a> ^ref-61837</p>
<hr>
<p>For companies selling high-value products or services, the most predictable source of leads (whether or not it’s the largest source) can be outbound sales prospecting. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=663">663</a> ^ref-55002</p>

<p>Here is a sample funnel that breaks out the prospecting stages: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=664">664</a> ^ref-28531</p>
<hr>
<p>Prospecting cycle length: Measure the time between a) when the prospect first responds to a campaign to b) when a quality opportunity is created or qualified (this means the quota-carrying Account Executive has re-qualified and accepted the opportunity that the prospector passed over). — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=676">676</a> ^ref-48805</p>
<hr>
<p>Don't make this mistake: companies are too dependent on cold calls. Phone skills are critical, but use calls as the second step in prospecting. Begin with email, and then use phone to follow up to people who respond. Simple email templates can get you an 8-12%-plus response rate even from high-level prospects. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=704">704</a> ^ref-59568</p>
<hr>
<p>Rather than sending hundreds of mass emails at a time in big bursts, the idea here is to send a regular, smaller number (50-100) of emails per salesperson each day, a few days a week, as a rolling campaign. The main goal of this stage is to generate just 5-10 new responses per day. Reps can’t handle more responses than that per day without dropping balls. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=708">708</a> ^ref-16152</p>

<p>What is the most important exercise you MUST do to get better results from marketing and sales? Answer: Get clear on your Ideal Customer Profile, including how to describe them, and what their core challenges are. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=722">722</a> ^ref-1192</p>

<hr>
<p>Targeting Fortune 5000? Try out OneSource. Targeting small business? Avoid OneSource and go for InfoUSA (as one example). Jigsaw (now owned by Salesforce.com) is perhaps the best general-purpose source of contacts with email addresses. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=759">759</a> ^ref-48433</p>
<hr>
<p>First, use email to generate internal referrals to the right person(s) at the target company. Then follow up on the responses and referrals with phone calls. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=788">788</a> ^ref-63461</p>
<hr>
<p>On any given day, the rep should send 50-100 targeted mass emails with a goal of having 5-10 responses per day (assuming about a 10% response rate). — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=790">790</a> ^ref-10684</p>
<hr>
<p>“Targeted” mass emails sounds like an oxymoron. Here’s how they’re targeted: filter your list carefully according to the specific kind of account or contact you want to touch. Examples of filters include: Vertical (retail, finance, high tech, etc) Revenue Geography / Territory Employee count Business model (B2B, B2C, agency) Last Contact Activity Date Last Account Activity Date Contact Title (CEO, Director of Marketing, etc.) Virtually anything else you are tracking So even if you have a database of thousands of names, an SDR can segment down their total prospect pool into small groups that can be messaged with highly relevant information. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=791">791</a> ^ref-60501</p>
<hr>
<p>Once you begin communicating, you can shift towards longer emails with more content, but in the beginning: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=805">805</a> ^ref-13919</p>
<hr>
<p>Send the messages either before 9am or after 5pm, and avoid Mondays and Fridays. (Sundays are okay.) — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=829">829</a> ^ref-56728</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are using emails, expect a 7-9%+ response rate (excluding bounces). This rate includes all responses: positive, negative and neutral. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=830">830</a> ^ref-6756</p>
<hr>
<p>When is the best day/time for a quick discussion around…?” (to set up a conversation with the prospect). — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=842">842</a> ^ref-42038</p>
<hr>
<p>For goal #2, setting up a call, the objective is to set up a quick time to see if there’s a high level fit between your company and the prospect’s company. This call should be focused entirely on their business—not your business. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=846">846</a> ^ref-13332</p>
<hr>
<p>You should lead the conversation and ask open questions that encourage them to talk about their business—not your business. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=848">848</a> ^ref-61015</p>
<hr>
<p>why. Remember, “No” doesn’t matter until you hear it from the CEO or your ideal decision maker. And even then when you get a No, you should find out why to determine if it’s coming from an objection you can handle. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=850">850</a> ^ref-17366</p>
<hr>
<p>You are allowed to send “unsolicited” emails to businesses. Here are the three core guidelines: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=865">865</a> ^ref-36769</p>
<hr>
<p>Assuming you are talking with a prospect who is a good fit for your service, the goal of “Selling The Dream” is NOT to “sell.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=872">872</a> ^ref-64298</p>
<hr>
<p>It is, rather 1) to help the prospect create a vision of a dream solution that will solve their problems; and then 2) to connect your product to their key business issue(s) and dream solution. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=873">873</a> ^ref-3935</p>
<hr>
<p>Once a prospector connects by phone with a prospect for a call to find out if there is a mutual fit, the biggest challenge is staying focused on the prospect’s business and not selling yours. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=880">880</a> ^ref-19423</p>

<p>Salespeople should use a nonthreatening, research-oriented approach that uses the first half of the call to learn about the prospect's business and needs. The salesperson positions their service and value at the end of the call, after they've uncovered what the prospect actually wants. This means they position the solution to the specific needs of the prospect without lots of distracting, irrelevant information and features the prospect doesn’t care about. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005ERYEGU&amp;location=966">966</a> ^ref-14987</p>

<p>Your job as a salesperson is to establish such value with your customers that they tell everyone they know how good you are and what a fantastic job you’ve done.

<p>The trial will only be a success if the prospect gets value and knows it. Everyone is busy, so pick your battle. Where can you show the biggest bang-for-the-buck?

<p>Give up trying to control how long someone takes to move forward. You’ll have to accept that most prospects who initially sign up for a blog, trial or demo just won’t be ready to do anything.

<p>It’s the same way with a blog. It’s imperative to be a resource for people and to pro-actively network with your blog by reading other blogs, linking to other blogs and leaving comments on other blogs, if you want people to do the same thing for you. It’s not necessarily the law of reciprocity, but it’s the law of participation.
