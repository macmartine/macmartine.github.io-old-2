<p>That is what I mean by collective intelligence. No single person knows how to make a computer mouse. The person who assembled it in the factory did not know how to drill the oil well from which the plastic came, or vice versa. At some point, human intelligence became collective and cumulative in a way that happened to no other animal. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=97">97</a> ^ref-1156</p>

<p>Humanity is experiencing an extraordinary burst of evolutionary change, driven by good old-fashioned Darwinian natural selection. But it is selection among ideas, not among genes. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=101">101</a> ^ref-2868</p>
<hr>
<p>This is what I mean when I talk of cultural evolution: at some point before 100,000 years ago culture itself began to evolve in a way that it never did in any other species – that is, to replicate, mutate, compete, select and accumulate – somewhat as genes had been doing for billions of years. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=107">107</a> ^ref-56843</p>
<hr>
<p>Just like natural selection cumulatively building an eye bit by bit, so cultural evolution in human beings could cumulatively build a culture or a camera. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=109">109</a> ^ref-40846</p>
<hr>
<p>Something else is necessary; something that human beings have and killer whales do not. The answer, I believe, is that at some point in human history, ideas began to meet and mate, to have sex with each other. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=113">113</a> ^ref-46189</p>

<p>Sex is what makes biological evolution cumulative, because it brings together the genes of different individuals. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=115">115</a> ^ref-8101</p>
<hr>
<p>The analogy is most explicit in bacteria, which trade genes without replicating at the same time – hence their ability to acquire immunity to antibiotics from other species. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=116">116</a> ^ref-65034</p>
<hr>
<p>I shall argue that there was a point in human pre-history when big-brained, cultural, learning people for the first time began to exchange things with each other, and that once they started doing so, culture suddenly became cumulative, and the great headlong experiment of human economic ‘progress’ began. Exchange is to cultural evolution as sex is to biological evolution. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=126">126</a> ^ref-15201</p>

<p>Specialisation encouraged innovation, because it encouraged the investment of time in a tool-making tool. That saved time, and prosperity is simply time saved, which is proportional to the division of labour. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=132">132</a> ^ref-50849</p>

<p>The more people are drawn into the global division of labour, the more people can specialise and exchange, the wealthier we will all be. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=135">135</a> ^ref-24172</p>

<p>It will not be easy, but it is perfectly possible, indeed probable, that in the year 2110, a century after this book is published, humanity will be much, much better off than it is today, and so will the ecology of the planet it inhabits. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=137">137</a> ^ref-5001</p>
<hr>
<p>The experience has left me mistrustful of markets in capital and assets, yet passionately in favour of markets in goods and services. Had I only known it, experiments in laboratories by the economist Vernon Smith and his colleagues have long confirmed that markets in goods and services for immediate consumption – haircuts and hamburgers – work so well that it is hard to design them so they fail to deliver efficiency and innovation; while markets in assets are so automatically prone to bubbles and crashes that it is hard to design them so they work at all. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=153">153</a> ^ref-23957</p>

<p>I am a rational optimist: rational, because I have arrived at optimism not through temperament or instinct, but by looking at the evidence. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=169">169</a> ^ref-16964</p>

<p>But overall, after fifty years, the outcome for the world is remarkably, astonishingly, dramatically positive. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=223">223</a> ^ref-34888</p>

<p>United Nations estimates that poverty was reduced more in the last fifty years than in the previous 500. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=233">233</a> ^ref-59731</p>

<p>Even inequality is declining worldwide. It is true that in Britain and America income equality, which had been improving for most of the past two centuries (British aristocrats were six inches taller than the average in 1800; today they are less than two inches taller), has stalled since the 1970s. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=275">275</a> ^ref-21059</p>
<hr>
<p>For example, high earners now marry each other more than they used to (which concentrates income), immigration has increased, trade has been freed, cartels have been opened up to entrepreneurial competition and the skill premium has grown in the work place. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=277">277</a> ^ref-64133</p>
<hr>
<p>The recent enrichment of China and India has increased inequality within those countries by making the income of the rich grow faster than that of the poor – an income gap is an inevitable consequence of an expanding economy. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=280">280</a> ^ref-16764</p>
<hr>
<p>‘once the rise in the position of the lower classes gathers speed, catering to the rich ceases to be the main source of great gain and gives place to efforts directed towards the needs of the masses. Those forces which at first make inequality self-accentuating thus later tend to diminish it.’ — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=283">283</a> ^ref-11806</p>

<p>This is what prosperity is: the increase in the amount of goods or services you can earn with the same amount of work. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=332">332</a> ^ref-12617</p>

<p>Healthcare and education are among the few things that cost more in terms of hours worked now than they did in the 1950s. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=337">337</a> ^ref-39528</p>
<hr>
<p>If Cornelius Vanderbilt or Henry Ford not only moves you faster to where you want to go, but requires you to work fewer hours to earn the ticket price, then he has enriched you by granting you a dollop of free time. If you choose to spend that spare time consuming somebody else’s production then you can enrich him in turn; if you choose to spend it producing for his consumption then you have also further enriched yourself. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=361">361</a> ^ref-45313</p>
<hr>
<p>Housing, too, is itching to get cheaper, but for confused reasons governments go to great lengths to prevent it. Where it took sixteen weeks to earn the price of 100 square feet of housing in 1956, now it takes fourteen weeks and the housing is of better quality. But given the ease with which modern machinery can assemble a house, the price should have come down much faster than that. Governments prevent this by, first, using planning or zoning laws to restrict supply (especially in Britain); second, using the tax system to encourage mortgage borrowing (in the United States at least – no longer in Britain); and third, doing all they can to stop property prices falling after a bubble. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=364">364</a> ^ref-13144</p>
<hr>
<p>The effect of these measures is to make life harder for those who do not yet have a house and massively reward those who do. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=368">368</a> ^ref-58110</p>

<p>‘All told, our time-series comparisons, as well as evidence from repeated international cross-sections, appear to point to an important relationship between economic growth and growth in subjective well-being’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=387">387</a> ^ref-4669</p>

<p>Getting richer is not the only or even the best way of getting happier. Social and political liberation is far more effective, says the political scientist Ronald Ingleheart: the big gains in happiness come from living in a society that frees you to make choices about your lifestyle – about where to live, who to marry, how to express your sexuality and so on. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=403">403</a> ^ref-27749</p>
<hr>
<p>That is what, it is now clear, far too many people and businesses did in the 2000s – they borrowed more from posterity than their innovation rate would support. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=444">444</a> ^ref-62141</p>
<hr>
<p>So long as somebody allocates sufficient capital to innovation, then the credit crunch will not in the long run prevent the relentless upward march of human living standards. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=455">455</a> ^ref-13604</p>

<hr>
<p>It may even be that parts of the world will be convulsed by a descent into autarky, authoritarianism and violence, as happened in the 1930s, and that a depression will cause a great war. But so long as somewhere somebody is incentivised to invent ways of serving others’ needs better, then the rational optimist must conclude that the betterment of human lives will eventually resume. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=469">469</a> ^ref-9950</p>

<p>Imagine you are a deer. You have essentially only four things to do during the day: sleep, eat, avoid being eaten and socialise (by which I mean mark a territory, pursue a member of the opposite sex, nurse a fawn, whatever). There is no real need to do much else. Now imagine you are a human being. Even if you only count the basic things, you have rather more than four things to do: sleep, eat, cook, dress, keep house, travel, wash, shop, work ... the list is virtually endless. Deer should therefore have more free time than human beings, yet it is people, not deer, who find the time to read, write, invent, sing and surf the net. Where does all this free time come from? It comes from exchange and specialisation and from the resulting division of labour. A deer must gather its own food. A human being gets somebody else to do it for him, while he or she is doing something for them – and both win time that way. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=472">472</a> ^ref-60747</p>
<hr>
<p>If you wish to have even the most minimal improvement in your life – say metal tools, toothpaste or lighting – you are going to have to get some of your chores done by somebody else, because there just is not time to do them yourself. So one way to raise your standard of living would be to lower somebody else’s: buy a slave. That was indeed how people got rich for thousands of years. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=489">489</a> ^ref-33669</p>

<p>This is what I mean by the collective brain. As Friedrich Hayek first clearly saw, knowledge ‘never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=551">551</a> ^ref-21843</p>
<hr>
<p>The point of all this cooperation is to make (Adam Smith again) ‘a smaller quantity of labour produce a greater quantity of work’. It is a curious fact that in return for this cornucopia of service, you produce only one thing. That is to say, having consumed the labour and embodied discoveries of thousands of people, you then produce and sell whatever it is you do at work – haircuts, ball bearings, insurance advice, nursing, dog walking. But each of those thousands of people who work ‘for’ you is equally monotonously employed. Each produces one thing. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=560">560</a> ^ref-15396</p>
<hr>
<p>So this is what poverty means. You are poor to the extent that you cannot afford to sell your time for sufficient price to buy the services you need, and rich to the extent that you can afford to buy not just the services you need but also those you crave. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=587">587</a> ^ref-58038</p>

<p>It is fashionable these days to decry ‘food miles’. The longer food has spent travelling to your plate, the more oil has been burnt and the more peace has been shattered along the way. But why single out food? Should we not protest against T-shirt miles, too, and laptop miles? After all, fruit and vegetables account for more than 20 per cent of all exports from poor countries, whereas most laptops come from rich countries, so singling out food imports for special discrimination means singling out poor countries for sanctions. Two economists recently concluded, after studying the issue, that the entire concept of food miles is ‘a profoundly flawed sustainability indicator’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=591">591</a> ^ref-25136</p>
<hr>
<p>In truth, far from being unsustainable, the interdependence of the world through trade is the very thing that makes modern life as sustainable as it is. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=601">601</a> ^ref-39416</p>

<p>two-thirds of modern hunter-gatherers have proved to be in a state of almost constant tribal warfare, and 87 per cent to experience annual war. War is a big word for dawn raids, skirmishes and lots of posturing, but because these happen so often, death rates are high – usually around 30 per cent of adult males dying from homicide. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=633">633</a> ^ref-27301</p>

<p>It was not just warfare that limited population growth. Hunter-gatherers are often vulnerable to famines. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=641">641</a> ^ref-60347</p>

<p>Why, asks Geoffrey Miller, ‘would the world’s most intelligent primate buy a Hummer H1 Alpha sport-utility vehicle’, which seats four, gets ten miles to the gallon, takes 13.5 seconds to reach 60 mph, and sells for $139,771? Because, he answers, human beings evolved to strive to signal social status and sexual worth. What this implies is that far from being merely materialist, human consumption is already driven by a sort of pseudo-spiritualism that seeks love, heroism and admiration. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=649">649</a> ^ref-56093</p>

<p>The cumulative accretion of knowledge by specialists that allows us each to consume more and more different things by each producing fewer and fewer is, I submit, the central story of humanity. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=658">658</a> ^ref-19347</p>

<p>We are used to thinking that technology and innovation go together, yet here is strong evidence that when human beings became tool makers, they did not experience anything remotely resembling cultural progress.

<p>Indeed, the analogy with a bodily function is quite appropriate. There is now little doubt that hominids spent much of those million and a half years eating a lot of fresh meat. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=722">722</a> ^ref-30912</p>

<p>nails where they should have had claws, they needed sharp tools to cut the skins of their kills. Because of their sharp tools they could tackle even the pachydermatous rhinos and elephants. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=724">724</a> ^ref-18664</p>
<hr>
<p>The rich meat diet also enabled erectus hominids to grow a larger brain, an organ that burns energy at nine times the rate of the rest of the body. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=726">726</a> ^ref-30224</p>
<hr>
<p>Meat enabled them to cut down on the huge gut that their ancestors had found necessary to digest raw vegetation and raw meat, and thus to grow a bigger brain instead. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=727">727</a> ^ref-41614</p>
<hr>
<p>Fire and cooking in turn then released the brain to grow bigger still by making food more digestible with an even smaller gut – once cooked, starch gelatinises and protein denatures, releasing far more calories for less input of energy. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=728">728</a> ^ref-9358</p>
<hr>
<p>As a result, whereas other primates have guts weighing four times their brains, the human brain weighs more than the human intestine. Cooking enabled hominids to trade gut size for brain size. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=729">729</a> ^ref-58346</p>
<hr>
<p>Erectus hominids, in other words, had almost everything we might call human: two legs, two hands, a big brain, opposable thumbs, fire, cooking, tools, technology, cooperation, long childhoods, kindly demeanour. And yet there was no sign of cultural take-off, little progress in technology, little expansion of range or niche. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=731">731</a> ^ref-29381</p>
<hr>
<p>Then there appeared upon the earth a new kind of hominid, which refused to play by the rules. Without any changes in its body, and without any succession of species, it just kept changing its habits. For the first time its technology changed faster than its anatomy. This was an evolutionary novelty, and you are it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=734">734</a> ^ref-5035</p>

<p>Some anthropologists argue that in east Africa and Ethiopia the toolkit was showing signs of change as early as 285,000 years ago. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=737">737</a> ^ref-39360</p>

<p>But recent evidence confirms that Neanderthals share the very same two mutations, which suggests that the common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern people, living about 400,000 years ago, may have already been using pretty sophisticated language.

<p>As you can tell, I like neither theory. I am going to argue that the answer lies not in climate, nor genetics, nor in archaeology, nor even entirely in ‘culture’, but in economics. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=791">791</a> ^ref-15376</p>

<p>Human beings had started to do something to and with each other that in effect began to build a collective intelligence. They had started, for the very first time, to exchange things between unrelated, unmarried individuals; to share, swap, barter and trade. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=792">792</a> ^ref-589</p>
<hr>
<p>Hence the Nassarius shells moving inland from the Mediterranean. The effect of this was to cause specialisation, which in turn caused technological innovation, which in turn encouraged more specialisation, which led to more exchange – and ‘progress’ was born, by which I mean technology and habits changing faster than anatomy. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=794">794</a> ^ref-60443</p>
<hr>
<p>Exchange needed to be invented. It does not come naturally to most animals. There is strikingly little use of barter in any other animal species. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=797">797</a> ^ref-63845</p>
<hr>
<p>Exchange is therefore a thing of explosive possibility, a thing that breeds, explodes, grows, auto-catalyses. It may have built upon an older animal instinct of reciprocity, and it may have been greatly and uniquely facilitated by language – I am not arguing that these were not vital ingredients of human nature that allowed the habit to get started. But I am saying that barter – the simultaneous exchange of different objects – was itself a human breakthrough, perhaps even the chief thing that led to the ecological dominance and burgeoning material prosperity of the species. Fundamentally, other animals do not do barter. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=820">820</a> ^ref-26052</p>
<hr>
<p>My argument is that this habit of exchanging, this appetite for barter, had somehow appeared in our African ancestors some time before 100,000 years ago. Why did human beings acquire a taste for barter as other animals did not? Perhaps it has something to do with cooking. Richard Wrangham makes a persuasive case that control of fire had a far-reaching effect on human evolution. Beyond making it safe to live on the ground, beyond liberating human ancestors to grow big brains on high-energy diets, cooking also predisposed human beings to swapping different kinds of food. And that maybe got them bartering. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=846">846</a> ^ref-45398</p>

<p>Having trained themselves to specialise and exchange between the sexes, having got into the habit of exchanging labour with others, the thoroughly modern Africans had then begun to extend the idea a little bit further and tentatively try a new and still more portentous trick, of specialising within the band and then between bands. This latter step was very hard to take, because of the homicidal relationships between tribes. Famously, no other species of ape can encounter strangers without trying to kill them, and the instinct still lurks in the human breast. But by 82,000 years ago, human beings had overcome this problem sufficiently to be able to pass Nassarius shells hand to hand 125 miles inland.

<p>Having conquered much of Africa by about 80,000 years ago, the modern people did not stop there. Genes tell an almost incredible story.

At least this is true of the Jarawa tribe on Great Andaman. The North Sentinelese, on the nearby island of North Sentinel, have not volunteered to give blood – at least not their own.

<p>The evidence of DNA attests that some of these beachcombers, on reaching India and apparently not before, must have eventually moved inland, because by 40,000 years ago ‘modern’ people were pressing west into Europe and east into what is now China. Abandoning the crowded coast, they resumed their old African ways of hunting game and gathering fruits and roots, becoming gradually more dependent on hunting once more as they inched north into the steppes grazed by herds of mammoths, horses and rhinoceroses. Soon they came across their distant cousins, the descendants of Homo erectus, with whom they last shared an ancestor half a million years before. They got close enough to acquire the latter’s lice to add to their own, so louse genes suggest, and conceivably even close enough to acquire a smattering of their cousins’ genes by interbreeding. But inexorably they rolled back the territory of these Eurasian erectus hominids till the last survivor, of the European cold-adapted sort known as Neanderthal, died with his back to the Strait of Gibraltar about 28,000 years ago. Another 15,000 years saw some of them spilling into the Americas from north-east Asia. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=955">955</a> ^ref-51300</p>

<p>‘Hurrah for late twentieth-century enrichment and democratisation. Hurrah for birth control and the civil rights movement. Arise ye wretched of the earth’. Interdependence through the market made these things possible. Politically, as Brink Lindsey has diagnosed, the coincidence of wealth with toleration has led to the bizarre paradox of a conservative movement that embraces economic change but hates its social consequences and a liberal movement that loves the social consequences but hates the economic source from which they come. ‘One side denounced capitalism but gobbled up its fruits; the other cursed the fruits while defending the system that bore them.’ — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=1515">1515</a> ^ref-32093</p>

<p>I hold no brief for large corporations, whose inefficiencies, complacencies and anti-competitive tendencies often drive me as crazy as the next man. Like Milton Friedman, I notice that ‘business corporations in general are not defenders of free enterprise.

<p>Most big firms are actually becoming frail, fragile and frightened – of the press, of pressure groups, of government, of their customers. So they should be. Given how frequently they vanish – by take-over or bankruptcy – this is hardly surprising. Coca-Cola may wish its customers were ‘serfs under feudal brandlords’, in the words of one critic, but look what happened to New Coke. Shell may have tried to dump an oil-storage device in the deep sea in 1995, but a whiff of consumer boycott and it changed its mind. Exxon may have famously stood out from the consensus by funding scepticism of climate change (while Enron funded climate alarmism) – but by 2008 it had been bullied into recanting. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=1537">1537</a> ^ref-59101</p>

<p>Companies have a far shorter half-life than government agencies. Half of the biggest American companies of 1980 have now disappeared by take-over or bankruptcy; half of today’s biggest companies did not even exist in 1980. The same is not true of government monopolies: the Internal Revenue Service and the National Health Service will not die, however much incompetence they might display. Yet most anti-corporate activists have faith in the good will of the leviathans that can force you to do business with them, but are suspicious of the behemoths that have to beg for your business.

<p>The innovations that made the world nicer, it may be argued, are institutions, not technologies: things like the golden rule, the rule of law, respect for private property, democratic government, impartial courts, credit, consumer regulation, the welfare state, a free press, religious teaching of morality, copyright, the custom that you do not spit at the table and the convention that you always drive on the right (or left if in Japan, Britain, India, Australia and much of Africa).

<p>They were as close to farming as you can get without genetic domestication of crops. Yet, at this moment, on the brink of making history, they regressed.

The same happened in Egypt about the same time – a retreat from grinding grain to hunting and fishing (except in Egypt’s case it was much longer before the proto-farming experiment resumed).

<p>Yet the environmental benefits of GM crops are already immense – pesticide use is falling fast wherever GM cotton is grown and no-till cultivation is enriching soil wherever herbicide-tolerant soybeans are grown. But the benefits will not stop there. Plants that are resistant to drought, salt and toxic aluminium are on the way. Lysine-enriched soybeans may soon be feeding salmon in fish farms, so that wild stocks of other fish do not have to be plundered to make feed. By the time you read this, plants may already be on the market that absorb nitrogen more efficiently, so that higher yields can be achieved with less than half as much fertiliser, saving aquatic habitats from eutrophic runoff, saving the atmosphere from a greenhouse gas (nitrous oxide) that is 300 times as potent as carbon dioxide and cutting the amount of fossil fuel used to make fertiliser – not to mention saving farmers’ costs. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=2121">2121</a> ^ref-51244</p>

<p>Between 1846 and 1860, Britain unilaterally adopted a string of measures to open its markets to free trade to a degree unprecedented in history. It abolished the corn laws, terminated the navigation acts, removed all tariffs and agreed trade treaties with France and others incorporating the ‘most favoured nation’ principle – that any liberalisation applied to all trading parties. This spread tariff reduction like a virus through the countries of the world and genuine global free trade arrived at last – a planetary Phoenician experiment. So at the crucial moment America could specialise in providing food and fibre to Britain and Europe, which could further specialise in providing manufactures for the consumers of the world. Both sides benefited. By 1920, for example, 80 per cent of all beef eaten in London was imported, mostly from Argentina, which was one of the richest countries in the world as a consequence. Both sides of the estuary of the River Plate became a vast slaughterhouse where beef was canned, salted and dried for export, the name of the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos turning into a synonym for canned meat in Britain. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=2540">2540</a> ^ref-38143</p>

<p>Farm subsidies and import tariffs on cotton, sugar, rice and other products cost Africa $500 billion a year in lost export opportunities – or twelve times the entire aid budget to the continent. Yes, of course, trade is disruptive. Cheap imports can destroy jobs at home – though in doing so they always create far more both at home and abroad, by freeing up consumers’ cash to buy other goods and services. If Europeans find their shoes made cheaply in Vietnam, then they have more to spend on getting their hair done and there are more nice jobs for Europeans in hair salons and fewer dull ones in shoe factories. Sure, manufacturers will and do seek out countries that tolerate lower wages and lower standards – though, prodded by Western activists, in practice their main effect is then to raise the wages and standards in such places, where they most need raising. It is less of a race to the bottom, more of a race to raise the bottom. Nike’s sweatshops in Vietnam, for example, pay wages three times as high as local state owned factories and have far better facilities. That drives up wages and standards. During the period of most rapid expansion of trade and out-sourcing, child labour has halved since 1980: if that is driving down standards, let there be more of it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=2570">2570</a> ^ref-57938</p>

<p>It was Britain’s fate to escape the quasi-Malthusian trap into which Japan, Ireland and Denmark fell. The reasons are many and debatable, but here it is worth noting a surprising demographic factor. Britain, more than any other country, had unintentionally prepared itself for industrial life in an elemental, human way. For centuries – leaving out the aristocrats (who left fewer heirs because they died from falling off horses) – the relatively rich had more children than the relatively poor. On average a merchant in Britain who left £1,000 in his will had four surviving children, while a labourer who left £10 had only two – this was in around 1600, but the differential was similar at other dates. Such differential reproduction happened in China, too, but to a much lesser extent. Because there was little or no increase in the standard of living between 1200 and 1700, this overbreeding by the rich meant there was constant downward mobility. Gregory Clark has shown from legal records that rare surnames of the poor survived much less well than rare surnames of the rich. By 1700, therefore, in Britain most of the poor were actually the descendants of the rich. They had perhaps carried down with them into the working classes many of the habits and customs of the rich: literacy, for example, numeracy and perhaps industriousness or financial prudence. This theory accounts especially well for the otherwise puzzling rise in literacy during the early modern period. It may also account for the steady decline in violence. Your chances of being a victim of homicide in England fell from 0.3 per thousand in 1250 to 0.02 per thousand in 1800: you were ten times more likely to be killed in the earlier period. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=2738">2738</a> ^ref-61024</p>

<p>When Asia experienced a population boom in the early twentieth century, it had no such emigration safety valve. In fact, Western countries firmly and deliberately closed the door, terrified by the ‘yellow peril’ that might otherwise head their way.

By 1950 China and India were bursting with the self-sufficient agrarian poor. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=2766">2766</a> ^ref-26615</p>

<p>Egged on by Western governments and pressure groups such as the International Planned Parenthood Foundation, coerced sterilisation became a pattern in many parts of Asia in the 1970s. ‘Dalkon Shield’ contraceptive devices, the subject of safety lawsuits in America, were bought in bulk by the American federal government and shipped to Asia. Chinese women were forcibly taken from their homes to be sterilised. Cheered on by Robert McNamara’s World Bank, Sanjay Gandhi, the son of the Indian prime minister, ran a vast campaign of rewards and coercion to force eight million poor Indians to accept vasectomies. In one episode, recounted by the historian Matthew Connelly, the village of Uttawar was surrounded by police and every eligible male sterilised. In response, a crowd gathered to defend the nearby village of Pipli, but police fired on the crowd, killing four people. A government official was unapologetic. In this war against ‘people pollution’, force was justified: ‘if some excesses appear, don’t blame me ... Whether you like it or not, there will be a few dead people.’ Eventually Sanjay Gandhi’s policies proved so unpopular that his mother lost an election by a landslide in 1977, and family planning was treated with deep suspicion for many years thereafter. Yet the tragedy is that this top-down coercion was not only counter-productive; it was unnecessary. Birth rates were already falling rapidly in the 1970s all across the continent of Asia quite voluntarily. They fell just as far and just as fast without coercion. They continue to fall today. As soon as it felt prosperity from trade, Asia experienced precisely the same transition to lower birth rates that Europe had experienced before. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=2781">2781</a> ^ref-1446</p>

<p>It is now a worldwide phenomenon: with the exception of Kazakhstan, there is no country where birth rate is high and rising. The pattern is always the same: mortality falls first, causing a population boom, then a few decades later, fecundity falls quite suddenly and quite rapidly. It usually takes about fifteen years for birth rate to fall by 40 per cent. Even Yemen, the country with the highest birth rate in the world for most of the 1970s with an average of nearly nine babies per woman, has halved the number. Once the demographic transition starts happening in a country it happens at all levels of society pretty well at the same time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=2827">2827</a> ^ref-64771</p>

<p>the best that can be said for sure about the demographic transition is that countries lower their birth rates as they grow healthier, wealthier, better educated, more urbanised and more emancipated. A typical woman probably reasons thus: now I know my children will probably not die of disease, I do not need to have so many; now I can get a job to support those children, I do not want to interrupt my career too often; now I have an education and a pay cheque, I can take control of contraception; now education can get my children non-farming jobs, I shall have only as many as I can support through school; now I can buy consumer goods, I shall be careful not to spread my income across too large a family; now I live in a city I will plan my family.

Coal makes the electricity that lights your house, spins your washing machine and smelts the aluminium from which your aeroplane was made; oil fuels the ships, trucks and planes that filled your supermarket and makes the plastic from which your children’s toys are made; gas heats your home, bakes your bread and makes the fertiliser that grows your food. These are your slaves. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=3233">3233</a> ^ref-31828</p>

<p>fossil fuels have spared much of the landscape from industrialisation. Before fossil fuels, energy was grown on land and it needed lots of land to grow it. Where I live, streams flow free; timber grows and rots in the woods; pasture supports cows; skylines are not scarred by windmills – where, were it not for fossil fuels, these acres would be desperately needed to power human lives. If America were to grow all its own transport fuel as biofuel it would need 30 per cent more farmland than it currently uses to grow food. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=3257">3257</a> ^ref-51375</p>

<p>Every acre of maize or sugar cane requires tractor fuel, fertilisers, pesticides, truck fuel and distillation fuel – all of which are fuel. So the question is: how much fuel does it take to grow fuel? Answer: about the same amount. The US Department of Agriculture estimated in 2002 that each unit of energy put into growing maize ethanol produces 1.34 units of output, but only by counting the energy of dried distillers’ grain, a by-product of the production process that can go into cattle feed. Without that, the gain was just 9 per cent. Other studies, though, came to less positive conclusions, including one estimate that there was a 29 per cent loss of energy in the process. Drilling for and refining oil, by contrast, gets you a 600 per cent energy return or more on your energy used. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=3298">3298</a> ^ref-50834</p>

<p>The pace of acceleration of returns lurched upwards around 10,000 years ago in the agricultural revolution. It then lurched upwards again in AD 1800 and the acceleration continued in the twentieth century. The most fundamental feature of the modern world since 1800 – more profound than flight, radio, nuclear weapons or websites, more momentous than science, health, or material well-being – has been the continuing discovery of ‘increasing returns’ so rapid that they outpaced even the population explosion. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=3374">3374</a> ^ref-49128</p>

<p>To explain the modern global economy, then, you have to explain where this perpetual innovation machine came from. What kick-started the increasing returns? They were not planned, directed or ordered: they emerged, evolved, bottom-up, from specialisation and exchange. The accelerated exchange of ideas and people made possible by technology fuelled the accelerating growth of wealth that has characterised the past century. Politicians, capitalists and officials are flotsam bobbing upriver on the tidal bore of invention. Even so, the generation of new useful knowledge is very far from routine, uniform, steady or continuous. Although the human race as a whole has experienced incessant change, individual peoples saw a much more intermittent flickering progress because the pace and place of that change was itself always changing. Innovation is like a bush fire that burns brightly for a short time, then dies down before flaring up somewhere else. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B003QP4BJM&amp;location=3414">3414</a> ^ref-25553</p>

<p>the pessimists are right when they say that, if the world continues as it is, it will end in disaster for all humanity. If all transport depends on oil, and oil runs out, then transport will cease. If agriculture continues to depend on irrigation and aquifers are depleted, then starvation will ensue. But notice the conditional: if. The world will not continue as it is. That is the whole point of human progress, the whole message of cultural evolution, the whole import of dynamic change – the whole thrust of this book. The real danger comes from slowing down change. It is my proposition that the human race has become a collective problem-solving machine and it solves problems by changing its ways. It does so through invention driven often by the market: scarcity drives up price; that encourages the development of alternatives and of efficiencies.

<p>But statistics, anecdotes and case histories all demonstrate that the one thing aid cannot reliably do is to start or accelerate economic growth.

<p>The key policies for Africa are to abolish Europe’s and America’s farm subsidies, quotas and import tariffs, formalise and simplify the laws that govern business, undermine tyrants and above all encourage the growth of free-trading cities. In 1978 China was about as poor and despotic as Africa is now. It changed because it deliberately allowed free-trading zones to develop in emulation of Hong Kong. So, says the economist Paul Romer, why not repeat the formula? Use Western aid to create a new ‘charter city’ in Africa on uninhabited land, free to trade with the rest of the world, and allow it to draw in people from the surrounding nations.
