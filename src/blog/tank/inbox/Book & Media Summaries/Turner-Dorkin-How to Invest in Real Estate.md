As Mark Cuban said, “It doesn’t matter how many times you fail. Each time only makes you better, stronger, smarter, and you only have to be right once. Just once.” You might struggle, you might falter, you might fail. But keep going. Entrepreneurship, whether it’s through real estate investing or something entirely different, has the power to change your life.

That’s why many investors will purchase those residential properties in their own name (as a sole proprietor) and then, after the purchase, will transfer the property into their corporation.
