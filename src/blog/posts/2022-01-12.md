This morning I spent some time brainstorming The Curious Innovater, the newsletter I’ve decided to start.

I spent a bit more time getting it set up, and wrote a brain dump of topics and modules I want to include, spent some time summarizing my goals with it, which I assume I’ll continue to modify. My being knows what it’ll be about, but I’m still trying to find the words to best articulate it concisely.

Here’s the current description:

> Insights for curious thinkers and doers.
> The aim is to empower curious individuals to reach their full potential through explorations on generating income, understanding human behavior, and living a fulfilling life.

I then spent some time mapping out the format, and outlining the first issue. I’d love to push the inaugural issue out tomorrow, but we’ll see. Crankin’ on the Aware relaunch now, save for this quick intermission.
