## Highlights
Dear So-and-So, I know you’re really busy and that you get a lot of emails, so this will only take sixty seconds to read. [Here is where you say who you are: add one or two lines that establish your credibility.] [Here is where you ask your very specific question.] I totally understand if you’re too busy to respond, but even a one- or two-line reply would really make my day. All the best, Tim — location: [818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=818) ^ref-35371

“Put your question right in the email,” he said. “It might be as simple as, ‘I’d like to discuss a relationship of some type that could take this-and-this form. Would you be willing to discuss it? I think a phone call might be faster, but if you prefer, I could throw a couple of questions your way via email.’ — location: [829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=829) ^ref-15437

“Luck is like a bus,” he told me. “If you miss one, there’s always the next one. But if you’re not prepared, you won’t be able to jump on.” — location: [900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=900) ^ref-49819

“It’s because you’re overthinking it,” he said. “Just tell yourself you’re calling your friend, dial the number, and start talking right away. The best cure for nervousness is immediate action.” — location: [1404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=1404) ^ref-19496

Aside from the money you live on, the rest is your money to play the game.” — location: [1502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=1502) ^ref-9128

“On the first sheet of paper,” Dan said, “write a list of twenty-five things you want to accomplish in the next twelve months.” I wrote things related to my family, health, working with Elliott, working on the mission, places I wanted to travel, and books I wanted to read. “If you could only do five of those things in the next three months,” Dan said, “which would you choose?” I circled them. Dan told me to copy those five things onto the second sheet of paper, and then cross them off the first. “You now have two lists,” he said. “On top of the list of five, write: ‘The Priority List.’ ” I scribbled it across. “All right,” he said. “Now over the list of twenty, write: ‘The Avoidance List.’ ” “Huh?” “That’s Mr. Buffett’s secret,” Dan said. “The key to accomplishing your top five priorities is to avoid the other twenty.” — location: [1674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=1674) ^ref-18367

“I tell college students, when you get to be my age, you will be successful if the people who you hope to have love you, do love you.” “No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time. You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.” “I insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business…So I do more reading and thinking, and make fewer impulse decisions than most people in business.” — location: [2105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=2105) ^ref-38367

“It’s like what Elliott told me,” I said. “One path leads to a linear life, the other an exponential.” — location: [2152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=2152) ^ref-10106

“Then you have to trust that it’s better that I teach you to fish, than if I get you the fish. Calling Mr. Buffett is easy. Learning how to get the yes on your own is what matters. You just need to get more creative in your next letter.” — location: [2265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=2265) ^ref-3371

“That’s my point! You need to start working on building a pipeline and getting other balls in the air. Business is not target practice.” — location: [2325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=2325) ^ref-3008

“I’ve had a lot of young people come to me expecting that somehow I could give them insights on how to succeed,” Kamen said. He lifted his gaze in thought. “Let’s say there’s a one-in-one-hundred chance you’re going to get something right. If you’re willing to do it more than a hundred times, you start to approach the probability that, eventually, you’re going to get it right. Call it luck. Call it tenacity. You will eventually get it if you exhaust all your efforts.” — location: [2392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=2392) ^ref-13507

“Look,” he said, “I’m not here to give you a road map. I’m here to tell you: this is what you should expect to see. If I gave you the map Lewis and Clark made, it would be pretty easy to get from here to the West Coast. That’s why everybody remembers the names Lewis and Clark and nobody remembers who read their map and took the trip the second time. — location: [2415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=2415) ^ref-11350

“If you don’t think you can deal with this amount of uncertainty and failure,” he continued, “then wait for Lewis and Clark to deliver the map and you can be one of those people who does a good job following their lead. But if you want to be one of those people who do what these innovators did, be prepared, like they did, to fail and get frostbite and have people not make it. If you’re not prepared for that stuff, that’s okay: don’t do it. There is plenty of room in the world for other people. But if you do want to do it—if you want to go off and do really big things—be prepared for them to take way longer than you thought, cost way more than you expected, and be full of failures that are painful, embarrassing, and frustrating. If it’s not going to kill you, keep trudging through the mud.” — location: [2417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B076NS2JSW&location=2417) ^ref-21764
