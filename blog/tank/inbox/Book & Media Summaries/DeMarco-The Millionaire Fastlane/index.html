<p>A 2003 World Value Survey (worldvaluessurvey.com) found that the happiest people in the world have a tight sense of community and strong family bonds. After basic needs are met (security, shelter, health, food), our happiness quotient is most significantly impacted by the quality of our relationships with our partners, our family, our friends, our spirituality, and ourselves. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=807">807</a> ^ref-59040</p>

<p>The World Value Survey concluded that “consumerism” is the leading obstacle to happiness. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=811">811</a> ^ref-49159</p>

<p>Money secures one agent of the wealth formula, freedom, which is a powerful guardian to wealth’s sibling ingredients: health and relationships. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=840">840</a> ^ref-28659</p>
<hr>
<p>Affordability is when you don’t have to think about it. If you have to think about “affordability,” you can’t afford it because affordability carries conditions and consequences. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=859">859</a> ^ref-61144</p>
<hr>
<p>Unfortunately, short-term feel-good is often long-term bad. Instant gratification is a populous plague and its predominant side effects are easily spotted: debt and obesity. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=873">873</a> ^ref-2208</p>
<hr>
<p>Ask yourself this: Which experience is more important? The experience of a menial job designed to pay your bills? Or the experience (and failures) of creating something that could provide you financial freedom for a lifetime without ever having to hold a job again? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=1284">1284</a> ^ref-60563</p>

<p>Anything that steals time and doesn’t have the power to free time is a liability. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=1446">1446</a> ^ref-48732</p>

<p>Azur was destroyed. He spent years doing the heavy lifting while Chuma built a machine to do it for him. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=1883">1883</a> ^ref-13773</p>

<p>Reshape life’s focus on producing, not consuming. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=1917">1917</a> ^ref-26896</p>
<hr>
<p>Applied, this means instead of buying products on TV, sell products. Instead of digging for gold, sell shovels. Instead of taking a class, offer a class. Instead of borrowing money, lend it. Instead of taking a job, hire for jobs. Instead of taking a mortgage, hold a mortgage. Break free from consumption, switch sides, and reorient to the world as producer. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=1918">1918</a> ^ref-42619</p>
<hr>
<p>When you encounter an advertising message that coaxes you to buy something, examine it from the producer perspective. How does this company make money? What is the aim of its message? What kind of business processes are involved in offering this product or service? Is this company making a profit? What is the revenue model? Is this product manufactured overseas or locally? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=1924">1924</a> ^ref-29041</p>

<p>Producers get rich. Consumers get poor. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=1934">1934</a> ^ref-48806</p>
<hr>
<p>To switch teams and become a producer, you need to be an entrepreneur and an innovator. You need to be a visionary and a creator. You need to give birth to a business and offer the world value. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=1935">1935</a> ^ref-53127</p>

<p>This book effectively transfers the act of income generation from me (the human asset) to the book (the business asset). — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=1944">1944</a> ^ref-9661</p>

<p>Contrary to this, Fastlaners buy and sell appreciating assets: businesses, brands, cash flows, notes, intellectual property, licenses, inventions, patents, and real estate. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2015">2015</a> ^ref-53260</p>

<p>Any time you have an asset that has sustainable profits, an industry multiplier governed by prevailing market conditions determines the valuation of that asset. Other people or companies will buy that asset based on the asset’s net profit multiplied by the assessed multiple. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2026">2026</a> ^ref-28687</p>
<hr>
<p>You already might be familiar with “multipliers.” Stocks trading on the public markets define the multiplier for each respective company by the price-to-earnings ratio, or PE. If a company’s stock trades at 10 times PE, investors are purchasing that company at a multiple of 10 times. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2030">2030</a> ^ref-41681</p>

<p>If your monthly income exceeds your lifestyle expenses including taxes, guess what? You’re retired! — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2117">2117</a> ^ref-17982</p>
<hr>
<p>Money trees are business systems that survive on their own. They require periodic support and nurturing but survive on their own, creating a surrogate for your time-for-money trade. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2122">2122</a> ^ref-55389</p>

<p>If you have a passive income that exceeds all your needs and lifestyle expenses including taxes, you’re retired. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2240">2240</a> ^ref-36452</p>
<hr>
<p>Compound interest pays my bills. It’s my tool. It’s my passive income source. Yet, compound interest is not responsible for my wealth. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2302">2302</a> ^ref-32534</p>

<p>As for earning your $10 million, that solution lies in exponential leveraged growth stemming from a Fastlane business—net income plus asset value—NOT in expenses, NOT in the stock market, and NOT in a job. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2328">2328</a> ^ref-20871</p>

<p>The Law of Effection states that the more lives you affect in an entity you control, in scale and/or magnitude, the richer you will become. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2362">2362</a> ^ref-45222</p>

<hr>
<p>If you can combine both scale and magnitude, we won’t be discussing millions but billions. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2382">2382</a> ^ref-51149</p>

<p>Scale creates millionaires. Magnitude creates millionaires. Scale and magnitude creates billionaires. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2383">2383</a> ^ref-64625</p>

<hr>
<p>Can’t get access to millions like an athlete? Then go directly to the source and serve the source. For example, agents of high-profile athletes are as rich as the athletes themselves because they have indirect contact to the Law of Effection. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2407">2407</a> ^ref-44356</p>

<p>The Law of Effection states that the more lives you affect or breach, both in scale or magnitude, the richer you will be. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2416">2416</a> ^ref-19115</p>

<p>S corporations also have some tax advantages because profits are not subject to the hefty self-employment tax that comes with sole proprietorships. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2464">2464</a> ^ref-28619</p>

<p>The point of this dissertation is that Fastlane success isn’t one choice. It’s hundreds. And when you line a string of choices together, they create your process, and your process will create your lifestyle. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2506">2506</a> ^ref-48901</p>

<p>Join entrepreneur clubs, attend networking events, ally yourself with like-minders, get yourself around people who subscribe to a Fastlane, anything is-possible mindset, and decide who you want on your team of warriors. Read books and autobiographies of those who have the kind of success you want. Find a mentor. Join entrepreneur forums with a Fastlane mindset, like the Fastlane Forum! Not a week goes by when someone doesn’t email me, “This forum changed my life!” That’s a tailwind! — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B004BDOUAI&amp;location=2829">2829</a> ^ref-11468</p>

<p>The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out; the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough.
