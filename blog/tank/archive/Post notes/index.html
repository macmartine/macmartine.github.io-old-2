<p>Unfortunately, many people don’t realize the long-term consequences that poor decision making can have on the trajectory of their life.</p>
<p>Spending time on the inconsequential decisions can take our focus from those that are consequential, leading us down less-than-desirable path, one where we will end up spending more of our time clean up messes made from poor past decisions.</p>
<p>Armed with some basic frameworks, we can smooth the way for a smoother future. This is often referred to as finding the “lead domino”, that decision that will create a more positive future and create less problems going forward.</p>
<p>This helps us avoid having countless obstacles in our way that we could have avoided.</p>
<h2>What do I do with all other types of decisions</h2>
<p>Decisions that do not fall into the consequential and irreversible quadrant can usually be handle by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delegating them</li>
<li>Ignoring them</li>
<li>Deciding quickly with intuition.</li>
</ul>
<p>By definition, the outcomes of these decisions are not life-changing and you can change your mind in the future without a big loss.</p>
<h2>How to I handle these big, overwhelming decisions?</h2>
<p>When faced with life-changing decisions, there are several tactics we can use to ensure we make the best choice we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow down</li>
<li>Gather information</li>
<li>Try things out</li>
<li>Think long term</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding which decisions are worth spending time on, and knowing how</h3>
<p>The people that end up spending most of their time putting out fires, and repairing past mistakes, or cleaning up messes, are doing so because they have a tendency to make decisions with failed priorities, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are in too big of a hurry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don’t realize the potential consequences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don’t look for ways to get their feet wet - to ease into it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They’d rather have things be easy now, and “deal with it later”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a better way.</p>
