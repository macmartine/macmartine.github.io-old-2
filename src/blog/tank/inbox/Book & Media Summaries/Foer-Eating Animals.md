## Highlights
The choice-obsessed modern West is probably more accommodating to individuals who choose to eat differently than any culture has ever been, but ironically, the utterly unselective omnivore — “I’m easy; I’ll eat anything” — can appear more socially sensitive than the individual who tries to eat in a way that is good for society. Food choices are determined by many factors, — location: [389](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=389) ^ref-47899

Ninety-nine percent of all land animals eaten or used to produce milk and eggs in the United States are factory farmed. — location: [418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=418) ^ref-52376

Beyond this literal forgetting of animals by eating them, animal bodies were, for Kafka, burdened with the forgetting of all those parts of ourselves we want to forget. If we wish to disavow a part of our nature, we call it our “animal nature.” — location: [462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=462) ^ref-54298

I felt shame for living in a nation of unprecedented prosperity — a nation that spends a smaller percentage of income on food than any other civilization has in human history — but in the name of affordability treats the animals it eats with cruelty so extreme it would be illegal if inflicted on a dog. — location: [508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=508) ^ref-22349

Animal agriculture makes a 40% greater contribution to global warming than all transportation in the world combined; it is the number one cause of climate change. — location: [522](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=522) ^ref-56456

raising animals for food (whether on factory or traditional farms) “is one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. — location: [723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=723) ^ref-25222

by controlling the light, the feed, and when they eat, the industry can force the birds to lay eggs year-round. So that’s what they do. Turkey hens now lay 120 eggs a year and chickens lay over 300. That’s two or even three times as many as in nature. After that first year, they are killed because they won’t lay as many eggs in the second year — the industry figured out that it’s cheaper to slaughter them and start over than it is feed and house birds that lay fewer eggs. These practices are a big part of why poultry meat is so cheap today, but the birds suffer for it. — location: [747](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=747) ^ref-17372

When we walk around thinking we have a greater right to eat an animal than the animal has a right to live without suffering, it’s corrupting. — location: [1184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1184) ^ref-41273

domestication took place when a handful of especially opportunistic species discovered, through Darwinian trial and error, that they were more likely to survive and prosper in an alliance with humans than on their own. — location: [1267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1267) ^ref-20158

Having little exposure to animals makes it much easier to push aside questions about how our actions might influence their treatment. The problem posed by meat has become an abstract one: there is no individual animal, no singular look of joy or suffering, no wagging tail, and no scream. The philosopher Elaine Scarry has observed that “beauty always takes place in the particular.” Cruelty, on the other hand, prefers abstraction. — location: [1300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1300) ^ref-21164

Despite these trends in processing, at the dawn of the twentieth century, animals were still largely raised on farms and ranches in much the same manner they always had been — and as most people continue to imagine. It hadn’t yet occurred to farmers to treat living animals like dead ones. — location: [1333](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1333) ^ref-40222

With these new alterations, drugs and confinement were being used not only to increase profitability, but because the birds could no longer be “healthy” or often even survive without them. — location: [1368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1368) ^ref-64628

For each food animal species, animal agriculture is now dominated by the factory farm — 99.9 percent of chickens raised for meat, 97 percent of laying hens, 99 percent of turkeys, 95 percent of pigs, and 78 percent of cattle — but there are still some vibrant alternatives. In the pig industry, small farmers have begun to work cooperatively to preserve themselves. And the movements toward sustainable fishing and cattle ranching have captured significant press and market share. But the transformation of the poultry industry — the largest and most influential in animal agriculture (99 percent of all land animals slaughtered are farmed birds) — is all but complete. — location: [1399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1399) ^ref-18540

Not a single turkey you can buy in a supermarket could walk normally, much less jump or fly. Did you know that? They can’t even have sex. Not the antibiotic-free, or organic, or free-range, or anything. They all have the same foolish genetics, and their bodies won’t allow for it anymore. Every turkey sold in every store and served in every restaurant was the product of artificial insemination. If it were only for efficiency, that would be one thing, but these animals literally can’t reproduce naturally. Tell me what could be sustainable about that? — location: [1420](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1420) ^ref-58815

Just the other day, one of the local pediatricians was telling me he’s seeing all kinds of illnesses that he never used to see. Not only juvenile diabetes, but inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that a lot of the docs don’t even know what to call. And girls are going through puberty much earlier, and kids are allergic to just about everything, and asthma is out of control. Everyone knows it’s our food. We’re messing with the genes of these animals and then feeding them growth hormones and all kinds of drugs that we really don’t know enough about. And then we’re eating them. Kids today are the first generation to grow up on this stuff, and we’re making a science experiment out of them. Isn’t it strange how upset people get about a few dozen baseball players taking growth hormones, when we’re doing what we’re doing to our food animals and feeding them to our children? — location: [1437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1437) ^ref-20279

THE 1918 PANDEMIC HAS BEEN remembered as the “Spanish flu” because the Spanish press was the only Western media to adequately cover its massive toll. — location: [1528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1528) ^ref-28863

The results, published in 2005, show that the source of the 1918 pandemic was avian influenza — bird flu. — location: [1560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1560) ^ref-19471

---
there is scientific consensus that new viruses, which move between farmed animals and humans, will be a major global health threat into the foreseeable future. The concern is not only bird flu or swine flu or whatever-comes-next, but the entire class of “zoonotic” (animal-to-human or vice versa) pathogens — especially viruses that move between humans, chickens, turkeys, and pigs. — location: [1563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1563) ^ref-60558

We can also be sure that any talk of pandemic influenza today cannot ignore the fact that the most devastating disease event the world has ever known, and one of the greatest health threats before us today, has everything to do with the health of the world’s farmed animals, birds most of all. — location: [1566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1566) ^ref-19112

---
Today the best evidence suggests that the avian source of the 1968 pandemic is not unique: scientists now argue that the primordial source of all flu strains is migrating aquatic birds such as ducks and geese that have roamed the earth for more than a hundred million years. The flu, it turns out, is all about our relationship with birds. — location: [1574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1574) ^ref-22744

H1, H2, and H3 — the three types of hemagglutinin that commonly attack humans — are specialists in binding to our respiratory systems, which is why the flu so often begins in the human respiratory tract. — location: [1586](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1586) ^ref-18489

consumers might notice that their chickens don’t taste quite right — how good could a drug-stuffed, disease-ridden, shit-contaminated animal possibly taste? — but the birds will be injected (or otherwise pumped up) with “broths” and salty solutions to give them what we have come to think of as the chicken look, smell, and taste. — location: [1626](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1626) ^ref-5609

chicken factory farms — well run or poorly run, “cage-free” or not — are basically the same: all birds come from similar Frankenstein-like genetic stock; all are confined; none enjoy the breeze or the warmth of sunlight; none are able to fulfill all (or usually any) of their species-specific behaviors like nesting, perching, exploring their environment, and forming stable social units; illness is always rampant; suffering is always the rule; the animals are always only a unit, a weight; death is invariably cruel. These similarities matter more than the differences. — location: [1698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1698) ^ref-63517

the factory farm industry (in alliance with the pharmaceutical industry) currently has more power than public-health professionals. The source of the industry’s immense power is not obscure. We give it to them. We have chosen, unwittingly, to fund this industry on a massive scale by eating factory-farmed animal products (and water sold as animal products) — and we do so daily. — location: [1764](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1764) ^ref-263

Breeding genetically uniform and sickness-prone birds in the overcrowded, stressful, feces-infested, and artificially lit conditions of factory farms promotes the growth and mutation of pathogens. — location: [1781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1781) ^ref-29220

Consider, for example, the National Dairy Council (NDC), a marketing arm of Dairy Management Inc., an industry body whose sole purpose, according to its website, is to “drive increased sales of and demand for U.S. dairy products.” The NDC promotes dairy consumption without regard for negative public-health consequences and even markets dairy to communities incapable of digesting the stuff. As it is a trade group, the NDC’s behavior is at least understandable. What is hard to comprehend is why educators and government have, since the 1950s, allowed the NDC to become arguably the largest and most important supplier of nutritional-education materials in the nation. Worse, our present federal “nutritional” guidelines come to us from the very same government department that has worked so hard to make factory farming the norm in America, the USDA. — location: [1825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1825) ^ref-27357

that tend to encourage dairy consumption in the name of preventing osteoporosis, Nestle notes that in parts of the world where milk is not a staple of the diet, people often have less osteoporosis and fewer bone fractures than Americans do.

In a striking example of food industry influence, Nestle argues that the USDA currently has an informal policy to avoid saying that we should “eat less” of any food no matter how damaging its health impact may be. Thus, instead of saying “eat less meat” (which might be helpful), they advise us to “keep fat intake to less than 30 percent of total calories” (which is obscure to say the least). — location: [1847](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=1847) ^ref-40557

The most successful legal battles against hog factory farms in the United States have focused on their incredible potential to pollute. (When people talk about the environmental toll of animal agriculture, this is a large part of what they’re talking about.) The problem is quite simple: massive amounts of shit. So much shit, so poorly managed, that it seeps into rivers, lakes, and oceans — killing wildlife and polluting air, water, and land in ways devastating to human health. — location: [2194](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=2194) ^ref-6358

For corporations like Smithfield, it is a cost-benefit analysis: paying fines for polluting is cheaper than giving up the entire factory farm system, which is what it would take to finally end the devastation. — location: [2249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=2249) ^ref-32119

Longlines today can reach seventy-five miles — that’s enough line to cross the English Channel more than three times. An estimated 27 million hooks are deployed every day. And longlines don’t kill just their “target species,” but 145 others as well. One study found that roughly 4.5 million sea animals are killed as bycatch in longline fishing every year, including roughly 3.3 million sharks, 1 million marlins, 60,000 sea turtles, 75,000 albatross, and 20,000 dolphins and whales. — location: [2429](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=2429) ^ref-39361

With feedlot-raised beef, the industry offends me less (and 100 percent pasture-raised beef, setting aside the issue of slaughter for a moment, is probably the least troubling of all meats — more on that in the next chapter).

there is no ethical difference between eating meat and throwing vast quantities of food in the trash, since the animals we eat can only turn a small fraction of the food that is fed to them into meat calories — it takes six to twenty-six calories fed to an animal to produce just one calorie of animal flesh. — location: [2667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=2667) ^ref-32428

We trade their most basic and important interests against fleeting human ones only because we can. Of course, the human animal is different from all other animals.

most people never have to confront the unpleasant fact that animal foods (including dairy and eggs) involve killing animals. They remain disconnected from this reality, buying their meats, fish, and cheeses at restaurants and supermarkets, already cooked or presented to them in pieces, making it easy to give little or no thought to the animals these foods come from. This is a problem. It has enabled agribusiness to shift livestock and poultry farming into unhealthy, inhumane systems with little public scrutiny. Few people have seen the insides of industrial dairies, egg or pig operations, and most consumers truly have no idea what is going on at such places. I’m convinced that the vast majority of people would be appalled with what goes on there. — location: [2759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002SSBD6W&location=2759) ^ref-8626

despite the pleasure we take in eating vast amounts, Thanksgiving is not about being gluttonous — it is about the opposite. Perhaps the turkey is there because it is fundamental to the ritual — it is how we celebrate Thanksgiving. Why? Because Pilgrims might have eaten it at their first Thanksgiving? It’s more likely that they didn’t. We know that they didn’t have corn, apples, potatoes, or cranberries, and the only two written reports from the legendary Thanksgiving at Plymouth mention venison and wildfowl.
