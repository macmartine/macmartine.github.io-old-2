Unfortunately, many people don’t realize the long-term consequences that poor decision making can have on the trajectory of their life.

Spending time on the inconsequential decisions can take our focus from those that are consequential, leading us down less-than-desirable path, one where we will end up spending more of our time clean up messes made from poor past decisions.

Armed with some basic frameworks, we can smooth the way for a smoother future. This is often referred to as finding the “lead domino”, that decision that will create a more positive future and create less problems going forward.

This helps us avoid having countless obstacles in our way that we could have avoided.

## What do I do with all other types of decisions

Decisions that do not fall into the consequential and irreversible quadrant can usually be handle by:

-   Delegating them
-   Ignoring them
-   Deciding quickly with intuition.

By definition, the outcomes of these decisions are not life-changing and you can change your mind in the future without a big loss.

## How to I handle these big, overwhelming decisions?

When faced with life-changing decisions, there are several tactics we can use to ensure we make the best choice we can:

-   Slow down
-   Gather information
-   Try things out
-   Think long term
- 
### Understanding which decisions are worth spending time on, and knowing how

The people that end up spending most of their time putting out fires, and repairing past mistakes, or cleaning up messes, are doing so because they have a tendency to make decisions with failed priorities, such as:

-   They are in too big of a hurry

-   They don’t realize the potential consequences

-   They don’t look for ways to get their feet wet - to ease into it

-   They’d rather have things be easy now, and “deal with it later”

Fortunately, there’s a better way.
