## Highlights
To teach these, I have developed a framework called the Six Ds of Exponentials: digitalization, deception, disruption, demonetization, dematerialization, and democratization. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=218) ^ref-6222

Of course, it’s not just Kodak. Anything that becomes digitized (biology, medicine, manufacturing, and so forth) hops on Moore’s law of increasing computational power.10 Thus the first of our Ds is digitalization, for the simple reason that once a process or product transitions from physical to digital, it becomes exponentially empowered. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=231) ^ref-65324

Nor is it just economists or, for that matter, Kodak executives. Skype demonetized long-distance telephony; Craigslist demonetized classified advertising; Napster demonetized the music industry. This list goes on and on. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=275) ^ref-38625

Skype demonetized long-distance telephony; Craigslist demonetized classified advertising; Napster demonetized the music industry. This list goes on and on. More critically, because demonetization is also deceptive, — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=275) ^ref-27220

Welcome to the New Kodak Moment—the moment when an exponential force puts a linear company out of business. — location: [414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=414) ^ref-55457

A Quirky user simply posts his or her product idea to the site, where other users vote on its feasibility and desirability. And what the crowd likes, the crowd builds, one crowdsourced, open-sourced step at a time. — location: [441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=441) ^ref-44667

The goal here is not to teach you how to become Ben Kaufman, it’s to teach you to harness exponential platforms like Quirky, or to encourage you to create similar platforms yourself. — location: [454](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=454) ^ref-37371

Most recently the company was valued at $10 billion—making it worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corporation ($8.4 billion)—and all without building a single structure.24 — location: [473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=473) ^ref-3831

But imagine being able to take your knowledge of what computers can do today back to the early 1980s—what bold entrepreneurial business opportunities might this have unlocked for you? — location: [536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=536) ^ref-46752

Recognizing when a technology is exiting the trough of disillusionment and beginning to rise up the slope of enlightenment is critical for entrepreneurs. — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=540) ^ref-1286

Reading an exponential curve like a road map, experts watch for a number of indicators—the development of best practices, supplier proliferation, secondary financings, among others. But for me, the most important telltale factor is the development of a simple and elegant user interface—a gateway of effortless interaction that plucks a technology from the hands of the geeks and deposits it with the entrepreneurs. In fact, it was exactly this kind of interface that transformed the Internet. — location: [541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=541) ^ref-26278

Fast-forward five years to mid-2013, when Google paid $1 billion to acquire Waze, an Israeli-based company that generates maps and traffic information, not via electronic sensors, but instead via crowdsourced user reports—i.e., human sensors, generating maps by using GPS to track the movements of some 50 million users, then generating traffic-flow data as those users voluntarily share information about slowdowns, speed traps, and road closures in real time. — location: [826](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=826) ^ref-60661

SmartThings makes an interface that can recognize over a thousand smart household objects, from temperature sensors that control the thermostat to door and windows sensors that tell you if you left something unlocked to ways to have appliances automatically shut off before you go to bed. — location: [847](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00LD1RZGM&location=847) ^ref-32117
