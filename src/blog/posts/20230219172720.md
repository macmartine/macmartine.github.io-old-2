We're in Bosnia this week.

So beautiful, such rich history.

As we rolled along, soaking it all in, I discovered something surprising...

A rush of creative thinking.

I was listening to Ryan Holiday's The Perennial Seller, about creating things that last, and marketing them. This may seem like an odd choice at such a time, but I noticed an interesting thing happening.

Ryan was talking about all the aspects of creative pursuits that people don't do because fear gets in the way. This relates to creation itself, as well as marketing.

Far removed from the binding sense of urgency I can have when in a daily routine in a familiar place, I felt my mind able to wander and explore ideas freely.

There was a sense of not having restrictions, no limits. I knew I wasn't going to be executing on anything today, and I wasn't committing to anything. I didn't even think that far ahead. I just watched my mind go wild generating ideas, and I noticed my heart-rate increase out of excitement.

Meanwhile, thinking about what happened in these parts in the not-too-distant past, made any sense of fear I might have in following through on any creative pursuits I may have almost literally fly out the window. They seemed so small and limiting, and I felt fueled with energy to squash those fears, seeing clearly that they weren't doing me any good.

So this is a reminder to not forget to give our minds space to wander freely.

And that growth comes from getting out of our comfort zone. The more we do, the bigger our comfort zone becomes, and the less energy it takes to do great things.
