<p>It is important to know whether or not the sum of the payoffs, counting winnings as positive and losses as negative, to all players is zero. If it is, the game is known as a zero-sum game. If it is not, the game is known (mathematicians are not very imaginative at times) as a non-zero-sum game. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00A3M1A6S&amp;location=369">369</a> ^ref-2815</p>

<p>plan. A strategy. is a plan so complete that it cannot be upset by enemy action or Nature; for everything that the enemy or Nature may choose to do, together with a set of possible actions for yourself, is just part of the description of the strategy. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00A3M1A6S&amp;location=388">388</a> ^ref-8866</p>

<p>This is an important concept in Game Theory, that of mixed strategies: the concept that a player should sometimes use one pure strategy, sometimes another, and that the decision on each particular play should be governed by a suitable chance device. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00A3M1A6S&amp;location=688">688</a> ^ref-40179</p>

<p>we shall refer to any one number which is at the moment a fugitive from a set of odds as an oddment. Thus if the odds are 8:5 and we want to talk about the 8 alone, we shall say that the oddment is 8; — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00A3M1A6S&amp;location=701">701</a> ^ref-2977</p>

<p>that there is some particular quantity of payoff in each game that good play will win for you, against good play by your opponent. This quantity is called the value of the game. You cannot on the average win more than the value of the game unless your opponent plays poorly. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00A3M1A6S&amp;location=750">750</a> ^ref-15525</p>

<p>In 2 × 2 games requiring a mixed strategy, the value of the game is the average payoff which results from use of the best mixture of one player against either pure strategy of the other. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00A3M1A6S&amp;location=756">756</a> ^ref-42839</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2 × 2 games which require mixed strategies, the average payoff is always the same (4½ in this game) when the good mixture of one player is tested against either pure strategy of the other. This average payoff is the value of the game. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00A3M1A6S&amp;location=763">763</a> ^ref-55305</p>

<p>The play of a game is not effected by adding a constant to all payoffs or by multiplying all payoffs by a positive constant. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00A3M1A6S&amp;location=774">774</a> ^ref-16202</p>
<hr>
<p>while the play is unaffected, the value of a game is effected when a coustant is added to, or multiplied into, the payoffs. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00A3M1A6S&amp;location=776">776</a> ^ref-6689</p>

<p>if the payoffs in one pair of diagonal boxes are small, and if those in the other pair are large, it is very important that a mixed strategy be used. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00A3M1A6S&amp;location=832">832</a> ^ref-22893</p>
