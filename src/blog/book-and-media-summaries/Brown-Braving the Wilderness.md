I need a permission slip to stop being so serious and afraid. I need permission to have fun today. That got the idea started. After I looked around my room to make sure no one was watching the incredibly ridiculous thing I was about to do, I walked over to the desk in my room, sat down, and wrote myself a permission slip on a Post-it note from my computer bag. It simply said, “Permission to be excited and goofy and to have fun.” — location: [254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=254) ^ref-50460

Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance. — location: [372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=372) ^ref-22585

---
Even as I wrote this, I still thought of belonging as requiring something external to us—something we secured by, yes, showing up in a real way, but needing an experience that always involved others. So as I dug deeper into true belonging, it became clear that it’s not something we achieve or accomplish with others; it’s something we carry in our heart. Once we belong thoroughly to ourselves and believe thoroughly in ourselves, true belonging is ours. — location: [376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=376) ^ref-64964

---
We seem to have forgotten that even when we’re utterly alone, we’re connected to one another by something greater than group membership, politics, and ideology—that we’re connected by love and the human spirit. No matter how separated we are by what we think and believe, we are part of the same spiritual story. — location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=381) ^ref-52824

---
They want to be a part of something—to experience real connection with others—but not at the cost of their authenticity, freedom, or power. — location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=388) ^ref-16344

---
Reluctant to choose between being loyal to a group and being loyal to themselves, but lacking that deeper spiritual connection to shared humanity, they were far more aware of the pressure to “fit in” and conform. Connection to a larger humanity gives people more freedom to express their individuality without fear of jeopardizing belonging. This is the spirit, which now seems missing, of saying, “Yes, we are different in many ways, but under it all we’re deeply connected.” — location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=393) ^ref-47613

---
True belonging is the spiritual practice of believing in and belonging to yourself so deeply that you can share your most authentic self with the world and find sacredness in both being a part of something and standing alone in the wilderness. True belonging doesn’t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. — location: [484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=484) ^ref-18336

The axiom was: “Faction before blood. More than family, our factions are where we belong.” Now that’s scary. But what’s even scarier is that it’s starting to edge closer to our reality than the nightmarish fiction it was conceived to — location: [578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=578) ^ref-47535

---
We experience loneliness when we feel disconnected. Maybe we’ve been pushed to the outside of a group that we value, or maybe we’re lacking a sense of true belonging. At the heart of loneliness is the absence of meaningful social interaction—an intimate relationship, friendships, family gatherings, or even community or work group connections. — location: [612](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=612) ^ref-29073

“To grow to adulthood as a social species, including humans, is not to become autonomous and solitary, it’s to become the one on whom others can depend. — location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=631) ^ref-44226

The ultimate goal of both global and domestic terrorism is to conduct strikes that embed fear so deeply in the heart of a community that fear becomes a way of life. This unconscious way of living then fuels so much anger and blame that people start to turn on one another. Terrorism is most effective when we allow fear to take root in our culture. Then it’s only a matter of time before we become fractured, isolated, and driven by our perceptions of scarcity. While the trends in sorting and loneliness predate 9/11, data show that they’ve grown significantly in the past fifteen years. — location: [668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=668) ^ref-28018

In a hardwired way, the initial trauma and devastation of violence unites human beings for a relatively short period of time. If during that initial period of unity we’re allowed to talk openly about our collective grief and fear—if we turn to one another in a vulnerable and loving way, while at the same time seeking justice and accountability—it can be the start to a very long healing process. If, however, what unites us is a combination of shared hatred and stifled fear that’s eventually expressed as blame, we’re in trouble. If leaders race too quickly to serve up an ideological enemy that we can rally against rather than methodically identifying the actual perpetrator, what we experience is an emotional diversion away from the unraveling that’s really happening in our homes and communities. — location: [672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=672) ^ref-29932

---
The flags are flying from every porch and the social media memes are trending, all while fear is burrowing and metastasizing. What feels like a rallying movement is really a cover for fear, which can then start spreading over the landscape and seeping into the fault lines of our country. As fear hardens, it expands and becomes less of a protective barrier and more of a solidifying division. It forces its way down in the gaps and tears apart our social foundation, already weakened with those delicate cracks. — location: [678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=678) ^ref-64916

---
As the larger world engages in what feels like a complete collapse of moral judgment and productive communication, the women and men I interviewed who had the strongest sense of true belonging stayed zoomed in. They didn’t ignore what was happening in the world, nor did they stop advocating for their beliefs. They did, however, commit to assessing their lives and forming their opinions of people based on their actual, in-person experiences. They worked against the trap that most of us have fallen into: I can hate large groups of strangers, because the members of those groups who I happen to know and like are the rare exceptions. — location: [729](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=729) ^ref-65386

---
And when we are in pain and fear, anger and hate are our go-to emotions. Almost everyone I’ve ever interviewed or known will tell you that it’s easier to be pissed off than it is to be hurt or scared. — location: [748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=748) ^ref-61230

---
Our families and culture believed that the vulnerability that it takes to acknowledge pain was weakness, so we were taught anger, rage, and denial instead. — location: [766](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=766) ^ref-57617

---
Anger is a catalyst. Holding on to it will make us exhausted and sick. Internalizing anger will take away our joy and spirit; externalizing anger will make us less effective in our attempts to create change and forge connection. It’s an emotion that we need to transform into something life-giving: courage, love, change, compassion, justice. Or sometimes anger can mask a far more difficult emotion like grief, regret, or shame, and we need to use it to dig into what we’re really feeling. Either way, anger is a powerful catalyst but a life-sucking companion. — location: [775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=775) ^ref-46805

---
Courage is forged in pain, but not in all pain. Pain that is denied or ignored becomes fear or hate. Anger that is never transformed becomes resentment and bitterness. I love what Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kailash Satyarthi says in his 2015 TED talk: Anger is within each one of you, and I will share a secret for a few seconds: that if we are confined in the narrow shells of egos, and the circles of selfishness, then the anger will turn out to be hatred, violence, revenge, destruction. But if we are able to break the circles, then the same anger could turn into a great power. We can break the circles by using our inherent compassion and connect with the world through compassion to make this world better. That same anger could be transformed into it. — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=794) ^ref-34064

Maiese explains that most of us believe that people’s basic human rights should not be violated—that crimes like murder, rape, and torture are wrong. Successful dehumanizing, however, creates moral exclusion. Groups targeted based on their identity—gender, ideology, skin color, ethnicity, religion, age—are depicted as “less than” or criminal or even evil. The targeted group eventually falls out of the scope of who is naturally protected by our moral code. This is moral exclusion, and dehumanization is at its core. — location: [839](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=839) ^ref-42998

---
The point is that we are all vulnerable to the slow and insidious practice of dehumanizing, therefore we are all responsible for recognizing it and stopping it. — location: [849](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=849) ^ref-5214

---
Today we are edging closer and closer to a world where political and ideological discourse has become an exercise in dehumanization. And social media are the primary platforms for our dehumanizing behavior. On Twitter and Facebook we can rapidly push the people with whom we disagree into the dangerous territory of moral exclusion, with little to no accountability, and often in complete anonymity. — location: [854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=854) ^ref-38822

“Is this an attempt to reduce someone’s humanity so we can get away with hurting them or denying them basic human rights?” — location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=866) ^ref-64020

---
When we engage in dehumanizing rhetoric or promote dehumanizing images, we diminish our own humanity in the process. When we reduce Muslim people to terrorists or Mexicans to “illegals” or police officers to pigs, it says nothing at all about the people we’re attacking. It does, however, say volumes about who we are and the degree to which we’re operating in our integrity. — location: [871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=871) ^ref-11304

It’s definitely messier taking a nuanced stance, but it’s also critically important to true belonging. — location: [897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=897) ^ref-41113

“When you love a place like we love Penn [State], you fight to make it better, to own our problems and fix them. You don’t pretend that everything’s okay. That’s not loyalty or love, that’s fear.” — location: [901](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=901) ^ref-2556

---
As we think about our journey from “fitting in” to striding into the wilderness of true belonging, we will be well served by understanding and recognizing the boundaries of respecting everyone’s physical safety, and not participating in experiences or communities that utilize language and/or engage in behaviors that dehumanize people. I think calling the latter “emotional safety” is inaccurate. — location: [908](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=908) ^ref-14630

When disagreements revolve around what happened in the past, it’s easy to fall into countless volleys of “you said…I said” back and forth. Focusing on what did or didn’t happen in the past, or what past events led to the current situation, usually increases tension and decreases connection. A critical first step is to shift the focus to “Where are we now?” and the most important turning point comes when we focus on the future. — location: [940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=940) ^ref-10468

I choose to focus on “conflict transformation,” rather than the more traditional term “conflict resolution.” To me, the latter suggests going back to a previous state of affairs, and has a connotation that there may be a winner or a loser. How will this disagreement be resolved? Whose solution will be selected as the “better” one? In contrast, I choose to focus on “conflict transformation,” suggesting that by creatively navigating the conversational landscape of differences and disagreements, we have the opportunity to create something new. — location: [948](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=948) ^ref-488

I believe, and tell my students, one of the most courageous things to say in an uncomfortable conversation is “Tell me more.” — location: [958](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=958) ^ref-44598

Help me understand why this is so important to you, or help me understand why you don’t agree with a particular idea. — location: [961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=961) ^ref-31401

one of the biggest drivers of the sorting that’s happening today is the proliferation of the belief that “you’re either with us or you’re against — location: [1057](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=1057) ^ref-10912

“The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.” — location: [1090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=1090) ^ref-49672

But when the stakes are high and we need to speak truth to bullshit, I’ve seen two practices that increase effectiveness. First, approach bullshitting with generosity when possible. Don’t assume that people know better and they’re just being malicious or mean-spirited. In highly charged discussions, we can feel shame about not having an informed opinion and these feelings of “not enough” can lead us to bullshitting our way through a conversation. We can also believe we’re responding from real data and have no idea that there’s nothing to back up what we’re saying. Additionally, we can get so caught up in our own pain and fear that truth and fact play second fiddle to emotional pleas for understanding or agreement. Generosity, empathy, and curiosity (e.g., Where did you read this or hear this?) can go a long way in our efforts to question what we’re hearing and introduce fact. The second practice is civility. I found a definition of civility from the Institute for Civility in Government that very closely reflects how the research participants talked about civility. The organization’s cofounders, Cassandra Dahnke and Tomas Spath, write: Civility is claiming and caring for one’s identity, needs, and beliefs without degrading someone else’s in the process….[Civility] is about disagreeing without disrespect, seeking common ground as a starting point for dialogue about differences, listening past one’s preconceptions, and teaching others to do the same. — location: [1093](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=1093) ^ref-21632

When our belief that there’s something greater than us, something rooted in love and compassion, breaks, we are more likely to retreat to our bunkers, to hate from afar, to tolerate bullshit, to dehumanize others, and, ironically, to stay out of the wilderness. — location: [1351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=1351) ^ref-16467

Here’s why we need to catch these moments of human spark and be grateful for them: Walk onto the pitch in Melbourne and ask the audience to stop singing the Liverpool anthem and start talking about Brexit, you’ve got a problem. Turn on the lights in the theater and ask the Harry Potter fans and their parents to discuss the pros and cons of public schools versus private schools versus homeschooling, Voldemort will look friendly. If you gathered the men and women of FM 1960 in a room away from the time and context of the Challenger tragedy and asked them whether the U.S. government should put more money into defense spending, social welfare programs, or space exploration, do you think you’d see a lot of random hugging and patting on the back? Turn the Garth Brooks concert into a political rally, and it’s likely you’ll see singing turn into a screaming match. All of these scenarios will more than likely fuel disconnection and reinforce assumptions that we are nothing alike. — location: [1494](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=1494) ^ref-1232

---
But the more we’re willing to seek out moments of collective joy and show up for experiences of collective pain—for real, in person, not online—the more difficult it becomes to deny our human connection, even with people we may disagree with. Not only do moments of collective emotion remind us of what is possible between people, but they also remind us of what is true about the human spirit. — location: [1501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XFLFSRY&location=1501) ^ref-12597
