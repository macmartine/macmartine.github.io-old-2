## Highlights
The Six is most out of touch with its own thoughts, thus Sixes look for reassurance and confirmation about what they think, or tend to get stuck in circular thinking patterns that have no grounding in their immediate experience. — location: [656](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=656) ^ref-52474

---
We refer to the three types on the equilateral triangle—the Three, Six, and Nine—as the “primary” personality types because they have the most trouble and are the most blocked in some way with feeling, thinking, or instinct. — location: [665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=665) ^ref-45621

---
As a result of thinking too much, unhealthy Fives create more problems for themselves than they solve because they have become so completely isolated from reality. They are unable to know what is real or unreal, true or untrue. — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=794) ^ref-10506

---
Unsure of themselves unless the authority is on their side, they nevertheless feel they must assert themselves against the authority to prove their independence, at least from time to time. Unhealthy Sixes succumb to anxiety and feelings of inferiority and insecurity, self-destructively bringing about the very consequences they most fear. — location: [799](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=799) ^ref-26016

---
Whereas Fives retreat from the external world of activity into the security of their minds, Sevens flee from the anxiety in their minds by finding security in the external world of activity. — location: [821](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=821) ^ref-2577

---
What Sixes depend on for security could be anything from a secure job to a good friend to a philosophical or religious system of thought. In any of these cases, Sixes illustrate clearly the central themes for the whole Triad: anxiety, a feeling of being without adequate support, and a search for security. — location: [826](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=826) ^ref-9625

---
It is worth noting that movement in the Direction of Disintegration is the “path of least resistance” and is the result of acting on the habitual mechanisms of our personality. On the other hand, the Direction of Integration always involves conscious choice and effort, although not the effort of striving and straining, or condemning ourselves for our failures. — location: [948](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=948) ^ref-21060

---
Rather, the effort required to move in the Direction of Integration is the effort of letting go of our old personality patterns. — location: [952](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=952) ^ref-54941

---
It is important to note that a person tends to act out the behavior of the type in his or her Direction of Disintegration at roughly the same Level in the Levels of Development as the Level at which they are functioning in their own type. — location: [1002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=1002) ^ref-26714

---
the goal is to move completely around the Enneagram, integrating what each type symbolizes and acquiring the active use of the healthy potentials of all the types. — location: [1023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=1023) ^ref-27046

---
A large part of this is a consequence of the extroversion of their psyches: virtually all their attention and energy is focused outward into the world. Sevens are not distracted by introspective ruminations which might cause them to withdraw from practical action. — location: [4716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=4716) ^ref-29219

---
Anger, in particular, is a powerful motivation for Ones. When they are confronted with circumstances which disappoint or displease them, anger becomes a form of fuel which launches them into action. Indeed, anger, rightly understood, is an instinctual response to a situation we are not satisfied with. It is the energy that allows us to say no. — location: [6572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6572) ^ref-58879

---
Ones often portray themselves as rational, but they are rational in the way that common sense is rational, not in the exploratory, intellectual sense. Ones do like ideas, but they like practical ideas, and unlike Fives, will not be long interested in ideas or concepts that do not lead them directly into constructive action. — location: [6580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6580) ^ref-53963

---
Ones repress the more irrational side of their natures, their instinctual impulses and personal desires, attempting to sublimate them in a quest for perfection. Their normal human desires gradually become more and more repressed as Ones are caught in conflicts between striving after ideals and implementing them in the real world. The picture is further complicated, however, because Ones relate to the world dualistically: they see themselves as less than the ideal, while giving the impression that they are also greater than the environment, which they are obligated to improve. They constantly measure not only the distance between themselves and the ideal, but also the distance between their present perfection and their past imperfection. Simply put, Ones feel that they and their world must be “making progress.” Anything that is perceived as blocking or frustrating progress toward the ideal is met with anger and criticism. — location: [6597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6597) ^ref-41059

---
The personality type One corresponds to the extroverted thinking type in the Jungian typology; it is one of Jung’s clearest descriptions. — location: [6613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6613) ^ref-26292

---
the full spectrum of the One’s traits encompasses some of the most noble and least admirable aspects of human nature. When they are healthy, Ones can be the most objective, principled, and wise of all the personality types. As much as humanly possible, they try not to let their personal feelings get in the way of dealing fairly with others. They are deeply concerned with justice, not merely for themselves but for everyone. But to contrast this, when they are unhealthy their lives are a relentless application of their ideals to every conceivable situation. Unhealthy Ones become extremely intolerant of anyone who disagrees with them, and since they are convinced that they alone know THE TRUTH (writ large, in capital letters), everything follows from that. — location: [6627](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6627) ^ref-27829

---
Ones develop as they do because as children they were disconnected from their protective-figure, that adult in their early childhood who was responsible for setting limits, giving guidelines, and disciplining the child when necessary. This is the person who occupies the traditional patriarchal role in the family. Often the protective-figure is the father, but not always. — location: [6635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6635) ^ref-26847

---
In other cases, the One may have experienced a fairly peaceful and normal childhood, but still felt that there was something more to strive for—some higher ideal than was part of the values of the child’s family or peers. Often, Ones felt uncomfortable being children, or were not allowed to behave as children, and thus struggled to become little adults before their time. For one reason or another, Ones decided that they had to rely on themselves for guidance, structure, and discipline. They would have to parent themselves, and they would have to do a better job of it than their protective-figure. — location: [6654](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6654) ^ref-62953

---
Ironically, Ones vent their anger most unfairly at others when they are primarily angry with themselves for not being perfect. Instead of resolving their own disordered feelings, average to unhealthy Ones find fault everywhere else. — location: [6663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6663) ^ref-27452

---
The aggression in their personalities is an expression of anger at themselves and others for not complying perfectly with the ideal. — location: [6666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6666) ^ref-61877

---
their anger signals the fact that they put too great a load upon themselves and others: perfection is a burden that human nature cannot bear. What is difficult for Ones to accept is the interdependence of flesh and spirit which is the natural state of man. The irrational part of themselves cannot be perfected or controlled in the same way that the rational part of themselves can be. Nevertheless, they try to control their irrational selves, denying all that is base, all that is human in themselves, in order to conform to the ideal. Ultimately, Ones feel guilty for being human. They fear being condemned because they are not angels. — location: [6668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6668) ^ref-31439

---
When Ones are healthy, however, their objective orientation to life allows them to remain firmly in touch with human realities, including their own. They are the most discerning, moral, and reasonable of all the personality types, tolerant of others and of themselves. They recognize that their ideals may not apply equally to everyone in all circumstances. When they are unhealthy, however, their behavior is a twisted caricature of their virtues because their humanity has become perverted. Unhealthy Ones punish others for their least faults while absolving themselves of their greater sins. They are completely without mercy, because they have lost contact with humanity. If ideals do not serve human beings, what purpose do they serve? — location: [6672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6672) ^ref-45225

---
Very healthy Ones are the wisest of the personality types because of their extraordinary discernment. Their judgment is superb because Ones are grounded in the real rather than the ideal. They go beyond logical reasoning to discern the best thing to do in whatever circumstance they are in. — location: [6689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6689) ^ref-26561

---
very healthy Ones can speak the truth in a way that others can easily hear. Others are not threatened by the One’s ideals. — location: [6700](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6700) ^ref-4122

---
The faith which very healthy Ones have in the moral order is so deep that they allow others, in their view, to be wrong all of their lives because they believe that error will not ultimately prevail over truth. They believe that what is true will always prevail because truth is of the nature of reality itself. This is why to be completely realistic is to be wise. Wisdom goes beyond reason, encompassing the irrational, taking it into account. It is to see the real order of things, and hence always to know what is right and good. — location: [6706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6706) ^ref-34995

---
For Ones, right and wrong are not abstract categories: they are passionate matters, and central to living a good and balanced life. — location: [6721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6721) ^ref-56772

---
Healthy Ones are so objective that they can stand aside from themselves and evaluate their own actions, attitudes, and feelings. They do not want to be in error but are glad to admit their mistakes as soon as they are aware of them. They feel that nothing is to be gained by clinging to mistaken notions. Righteousness and truthfulness are important to them, not holding erroneous opinions out of pride. Within the limitations of personality and culture, Ones know right from wrong and good from bad because they have healthy consciences. Their consciences motivate them to do what they believe is right. — location: [6724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6724) ^ref-54540

---
Many of the most worthwhile gains of civilization result from their willingness to delay personal rewards for long-term, higher goals. — location: [6737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6737) ^ref-25496

---
healthy Ones are extremely concerned that others be treated fairly. They hate injustice wherever they find it, whether it is their friends, total strangers, or they themselves who are harmed by injustice. Healthy Ones are on fire for justice and righteousness—these are not arid principles, they are their passions. — location: [6746](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6746) ^ref-30948

---
Healthy Ones have enormous integrity and are extremely ethical: to lie or to cheat someone is virtually unthinkable. — location: [6751](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6751) ^ref-43951

---
Ones want to feel more than anything else that they have made some positive contribution to the world, and often experience themselves as having a sense of mission—a serious purpose. — location: [6759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6759) ^ref-12188

---
Healthy Ones are nothing if not self-disciplined. They are able to stay on track, putting distractions, comforts, and the temptation of easy solutions aside to accomplish their purposes. — location: [6764](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6764) ^ref-60251

---
This is perhaps the highest form of teaching, not limited to merely passing on a body of knowledge but communicating a vision of a balanced way to live. — location: [6768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6768) ^ref-2695

---
Healthy Ones teach by personal example, not by preaching to others. They are confident that, whether or not others listen to them, the truth will ultimately be heard because the truth speaks to the soul in a voice which cannot be ignored. — location: [6771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6771) ^ref-63569

---
The difference between healthy Ones and average Ones is that average Ones become convinced that they alone have the answer for everyone. They alone can “fix up” the disorder they see around them. — location: [6778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6778) ^ref-26391

---
The weight of moral “shoulds” and “oughts” makes itself felt: not only should Ones do or not do this or that, but so should everyone else. — location: [6783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6783) ^ref-50172

---
They are ever mindful of how they are approximating their ideals, so progress is an important concept for them: they very much want to measure—at least by their moral yardstick—their improvement in whatever spheres concern them. Thus, they are extremely purposeful, always having a higher goal in view. They may feel that they should never watch television for entertainment, only for education, since they should always be improving themselves and doing something worthwhile. — location: [6792](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6792) ^ref-58288

---
They want to have control over every area of their lives, particularly over their own impulses and emotions. — location: [6804](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6804) ^ref-41613

---
Orderly everywhere, they make lists and plan their schedules carefully so they will not waste time. Time is extremely important to them, and average Ones are always able to account for their use of it. They are always on time and insist that others be equally punctual. — location: [6813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6813) ^ref-64841

---
Having proper manners allows average Ones to function socially without reference to their personal feelings. — location: [6832](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6832) ^ref-57950

---
Since self-control is their desire, average Ones take sides against their impulses, doing the opposite of what they would like to do, as if their personal inclinations were somehow suspect. If Ones want to do something, like going to a movie, they will give it up, because they feel that they must devote their time to more serious projects. On the other hand, if they do not want to do something, such as work on the weekend, they will force themselves to do so, because they feel obliged to. — location: [6833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6833) ^ref-46426

---
Their musculature is frequently tight: lips pursed, teeth clenched, neck and face stiff. Tense, taut, stiff, and rigid are words that can be applied to much of their behavior, as well as to their emotional world at this stage. — location: [6840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6840) ^ref-27858

---
From this stage onward, Ones attempt to control themselves and the environment ever more tightly so that their prohibitions will keep their irrational impulses in place. Not lessening their desire for internal and external order, they begin to become obsessed with rooting out disorder everywhere. — location: [6849](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=6849) ^ref-14595

---
As we have seen, Ones exercise too much control over their feelings and impulses. The essence of the move to Seven is that integrating Ones relax and learn to take delight in life. They learn to trust themselves and reality, becoming life-affirming rather than controlled and constricted. They discover that life is not always grim and serious: happiness is a legitimate response to existence. Pleasure can be taken without sinking into the morass of sensuality; people can please and fulfill themselves without becoming irresponsible or selfish. Integrating Ones no longer feel that they must make everything perfect. Thus they progress from obligation to enthusiasm, from constraint to freedom of action. They are more relaxed and productive, and are able to express their feelings spontaneously. Integrating Ones are more responsive to the world, more playful, and much happier. A great burden has been lifted from them, the burden of unnecessary perfection. They realize that they can enjoy what is good in life without constantly feeling obligated to improve it, especially in those areas in which perfection is not an issue. Things do not have to be perfect to be good. (“This is good, but so is that.”) They realize that much in life is already very good, even wonderful. Integrating Ones marvel at nature, the beauty of the arts, or the extraordinary accomplishments of others who, like they, are imperfect, yet have been able to make valuable contributions. Moreover, they discover that it is frequently possible for them to be flexible without compromising genuine values. The old adage “The good is not the enemy of the better” becomes meaningful. They stop preaching from the abstract and experience life as it is. Integrating Ones have come down from Olympus to join the human race. — location: [7020](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=7020) ^ref-45562

---
It is important to realize that the personality type in the Direction of Disintegration is not unhealthy in any absolute sense since it is, after all, another personality type—and no type is fundamentally unhealthy. The type lying in the Direction of Disintegration is considered “unhealthy” only because it embodies what we most need for our personal development, but for a reason inherent in the character structure of our basic type, we cannot yet deal with. Therefore, the type which lies in the Direction of Disintegration is only relatively unhealthy because we cannot immediately integrate into ourselves the psychological capacities it symbolizes. The unhealthy type represents those aspects of ourselves which are the most difficult for us to come to terms with. — location: [7142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=7142) ^ref-29416

---
We are often tempted to move in our Direction of Disintegration because the normal and neurotic conflicts we get into impel us to find a quick solution to our emotional needs. The type which is in the Direction of Disintegration seems to hold out the promise of being just such a solution, although it never is. — location: [7156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=7156) ^ref-50894

---
the primary types have a more difficult time integrating because they are more seriously blocked by the root problem of their respective Triads. — location: [7178](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=7178) ^ref-6174

---
The great fluidity of human nature—the way people change from day to day and even from moment to moment—can, at least in part, be attributed to the fact that we constantly move along the Levels of our personality type. — location: [7252](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=7252) ^ref-31342

---
the Instinctual types tell us in which of life’s domains the personality will exert itself most powerfully. However, to the degree that the personality is neurotic, that is, the further down the Levels of Development a person is functioning, the more the personality type will interfere with the natural expression of the instinct. Hence, the lower levels of the Instinctual variants often produce the opposite of the normal function of the Instinct: Self-Preservation types become destructive of their health and security; Social types become antisocial, alienating others; and Sexual types develop problems with the expressions of their sexuality, perhaps as promiscuity or psychologically based sexual dysfunction. — location: [7362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=7362) ^ref-45558

---
Self-Preservation types are focused on enhancing their personal security and physical comfort. — location: [7379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=7379) ^ref-3083

---
To review Jung’s system for a moment, Jung posited that there are two general psychological attitudes (extroversion and introversion) and four psychological functions (thinking, feeling, intuition, and sensation). — location: [7574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=7574) ^ref-28872

---
At Level 2, however, unlike all of the other Levels, the B-term has a different significance. The B-term column at Level 2 represents the person’s self-image; thus, the terms here could be called “I am” terms because they represent the way that the type sees itself. — location: [8049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=8049) ^ref-52906

---
Note that at Level 3, and in all subsequent Levels, the A-terms represent attitudes or internal states of consciousness which are generally invisible to other people. The B-terms represent behaviors, actions, or styles of self-expression which generally are visible to other people. — location: [8070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=8070) ^ref-19203

---
It then follows that the way to lighten the burden of one’s more painful, defended states is to follow the spiral up against the arrows. This means allowing one’s self to experience the fear at the Level in which one finds one’s self, and all the subsequent fears above it. It also means allowing one’s self to let go of the behaviors, attitudes, and desires that one may be clinging to, by recognizing that there are more effective means to realize what one really wants—the Basic Desire. — location: [8090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004MYFLAY&location=8090) ^ref-6044
