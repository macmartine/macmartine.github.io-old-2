<p>Invest where you travel. Do you have a favorite destination? Consider investing in the area. It gives you a great reason to keep returning, and you turn the travel expenses you already have into deductible expenses, keeping more money in your pocket. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=426">426</a> ^ref-50598</p>

<p>Put your family to work. Make your business a family business. Then when you travel for business, your family’s travel is deductible. And you can shift income from your higher tax bracket to their lower tax bracket. This creates permanent tax savings. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=753">753</a> ^ref-15301</p>

<p>You have to become an active investor. That means you have to be an investor who actively invests for passive income, not earned income. Very simply, passive income is income that comes from dividends, rents, and business. It’s taxed at a much lower rate than earned income, which comes from appreciation and capital gains, or from your paycheck. In order to become a super investor, you must find good, cash-flowing investments that produce passive income. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=868">868</a> ^ref-57233</p>

<p>Sure, you may have interest expense for the loan or certain out-of-pocket expenses associated with maintenance, but those expenses are also deductible. The actual building cost is a non-cash expense (an expense that doesn’t reduce your cash flow) that gives you a deduction. Even better, you not only get a deduction for the money you put into the building but you also get a deduction for the money the bank puts into the building. That’s right, you get a depreciation deduction for the entire cost of the building, even if you borrowed all the cash to pay for it from someone else. Now that’s what I call magic. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=996">996</a> ^ref-38066</p>

<p>When Pierre bought the land and the building he also bought what was inside the building and the landscaping and other improvements outside of the building (such as the fencing or the parking lot). He bought all of the floor coverings, the window coverings, the cabinetry, and more. So a portion of the $780,000 price tag for the building really applies to these other items. This is important because these other items can be depreciated faster than the building, putting more money into his pocket faster. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=1001">1001</a> ^ref-37385</p>

<p>Avoid the tax collector’s traps. The trick is to properly document the values of all the items you depreciate in a cost segregation or chattel appraisal—even better, have a tax professional or engineer document them for you. Without it, the tax collector can make your tax savings from depreciation disappear. Protect your tax savings with good documentation. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=1015">1015</a> ^ref-58955</p>

<p>Some people might be concerned that with like-kind exchanges they won’t be able to get any actual cash in their pockets from the sale of their property. This isn’t true, however, because you can always refinance the property and pull out tax-free appreciated value. And even if you do that, you can still do another rollover or exchange later on and not pay taxes. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=1268">1268</a> ^ref-11101</p>

<p>Losses from passive investments in business and real estate can only offset income from those same or similar investments. While this may seem like a challenge for passive investment activities, it’s really a great benefit. The key is to manage your investments so that you have both passive income and passive losses. Remember that the magical deduction of depreciation can really help here. For instance, depreciation from your real estate investments can offset the income from your business investments. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=1307">1307</a> ^ref-44099</p>

<p>If you don’t spend much time in the business, you are considered to be a passive investor, and income and loss from the business that is reported on your return (through a partnership or S corporation) is treated as passive income and loss. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=1340">1340</a> ^ref-22997</p>

<p>Think about that. As an employee or even as a self-employed individual, you will have to pay high government insurance (e.g., Medicare) and/or Social Security taxes on most or all of your income. If, on the other hand, you earn all of your income through investments, such as stock dividends and capital gains, real estate rentals, oil and gas investments, or business distributions, you can avoid most if not all of these additional taxes. And yes, they are additional taxes because they are taxes in addition to your income tax. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=1787">1787</a> ^ref-36295</p>

<p>But when you invest in the stock market through your government-sponsored retirement plan, these lower tax rates go away. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=3045">3045</a> ^ref-40121</p>
<hr>
<p>When you invest in the stock market through a qualified retirement plan, like a 401(k), all of the income you earn is eventually taxed at the regular tax rates. So, instead of the preferred capital gains rate, that same income is taxed at ordinary income rates when you withdraw it from your retirement plan. This alone can more than double the tax rate on your investment earnings. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=3046">3046</a> ^ref-31797</p>

<p>The reality is that if you’re going to have as much money when you retire as you do now, then you probably will be in a higher tax bracket than you are today. Why? Because you likely won’t have the deductions, exemptions, or credits that you currently enjoy for your children, for your house, or even for your business. After all, you want to be retired. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=3081">3081</a> ^ref-33628</p>

<p>Most businesses these days sell a lot of their products to customers who live in other countries. Income from overseas customers often can be sheltered from taxes in your country, as well as from taxes in the country where your customer lives. This type of tax planning is called “offshore” tax planning. There is an entire industry of tax planning dedicated to it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=3304">3304</a> ^ref-18160</p>

<p>Once your tax basis in a property goes to zero, you don’t get any more depreciation. And when you sell the property, your gain is calculated as the difference between your tax basis and your sales price. This is a basic accounting principle that applies throughout the world. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=3399">3399</a> ^ref-64267</p>

<p>In many countries, however, you can completely avoid the gain on the sale of your property, including the depreciation recapture, simply by buying another investment property for the same price or more than the one you sold through a tax-free or like-kind exchange—also referred to as a Section 1031 exchange in the United States after the section of the Internal Revenue Code that allows this tax treatment. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07J1WNBKT&amp;location=3435">3435</a> ^ref-38954</p>
