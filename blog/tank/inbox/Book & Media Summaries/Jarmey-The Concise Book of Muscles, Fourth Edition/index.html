<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>The location where a muscle attaches to a relatively stationary point on a bone, either directly or via a tendon, is called the origin. When the muscle contracts, it transmits tension to the bones across one or more joints, and movement occurs. The end of the muscle that attaches to the bone that moves is called the insertion. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07CKB61MF&amp;location=359">359</a> ^ref-22550</p>

<p>When the connective tissue components of a muscle combine and extend beyond the end of the muscle as round cords or flat bands, the tendinous attachment is called a tendon; — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07CKB61MF&amp;location=367">367</a> ^ref-33101</p>

<p>If the contraction of a muscle results in no movement, such a contraction is called isometric; if movement of some sort results, the contraction is called isotonic. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07CKB61MF&amp;location=385">385</a> ^ref-26580</p>

<p>Isotonic contractions of muscle enable us to move about. Such contractions are of two types: concentric and eccentric. In concentric contractions, the muscle attachments move closer together, causing movement at the joint. In the example of holding an object in the hand, if the biceps muscle contracts concentrically, the elbow joint will flex and the hand will move toward the shoulder. Similarly, if we look up at the ceiling, the muscles at the back of the neck must contract concentrically to tilt the head back and extend the neck. Figure 2.3. Abdominal muscles contract concentrically to raise the body. Eccentric contraction means that the muscle fibers “pay out” in a controlled manner to slow down movements in a case where gravity, if unchecked, would otherwise cause them to occur too rapidly, as, for example, when lowering an object held in the hand down to your side. Another everyday example is simply sitting down onto a chair. Therefore, the difference between concentric and eccentric contractions is that in the former, the muscle shortens, while in the latter, it actually lengthens. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07CKB61MF&amp;location=396">396</a> ^ref-32753</p>
