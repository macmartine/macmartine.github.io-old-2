<p>If you could just sit for thirty minutes and be happy, you are successful. That is a very powerful place to be, but very few of us get there. [6] — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B08FF8MTM6&amp;location=1345">1345</a> ^ref-25394</p>

<p>You can get almost anything you want out of life, as long as it’s one thing and you want it far more than anything else. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B08FF8MTM6&amp;location=1352">1352</a> ^ref-9715</p>

<p>Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion. You can convert peace into happiness anytime you want. But peace is what you want most of the time.

<p>Today, the way we think you get peace is by resolving all your external problems. But there are unlimited external problems. The only way to actually get peace on the inside is by giving up this idea of problems. [77] — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B08FF8MTM6&amp;location=1356">1356</a> ^ref-27188</p>

<p>don’t think life is that hard. I think we make it hard. One of the things I’m trying to get rid of is the word “should.” Whenever the word “should” creeps up in your mind, it’s guilt or social programming. Doing something because you “should” basically means you don’t actually want to do it. It’s just making you miserable, so I’m trying to eliminate as many “shoulds” from my life as possible. [1] — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B08FF8MTM6&amp;location=1358">1358</a> ^ref-41458</p>

<p>Just being very aware in every moment. If I catch myself judging somebody, I can stop myself and say, “What’s the positive interpretation of this?” I used to get annoyed about things. Now I always look for the positive side of it. It used to take a rational effort. It used to take a few seconds for me to come up with a positive. Now I can do it sub-second. [7] — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B08FF8MTM6&amp;location=1435">1435</a> ^ref-34563</p>

<p>You’re going to die one day, and none of this is going to matter. So enjoy yourself. Do something positive. Project some love. Make someone happy. Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment. And do your work. [8] — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B08FF8MTM6&amp;location=1508">1508</a> ^ref-50133</p>
