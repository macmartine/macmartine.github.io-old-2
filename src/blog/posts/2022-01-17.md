## Thought: AI and the future

### AI and your career

ChatGPT and what's coming will have wide-range consequences in the the world as a whole.

Many types of writer are concerned about losing their jobs, and rightfully so.




### Education and the consequences of AI

AI is going to hit the education system hard, and universities are already <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/technology/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-universities.html?' target='_blank'>grappling with this</a>.

Why write a paper when you can just ask AI just write a better one in a few seconds? Want is simply articulated for a 5-year-old, or would you prefer it read like a legal document or scientific journal? Just say so.

Need the answer to a question that's beyond the capabilities of Google, or need some code written for you (and yes, I've already been using it for this)? Done.

It will be so easy to cheat (and it already is) that it seems almost hopeless to try to stop it. Trying to stay ahead of the technology in this way will be an enourmous feat for universities. They'll need to find a different way.

At the same time, the advancements in AI will greatly alter what is important to learn. For example, it's easy to argue now that communication skills are important, but ChatGPT arguably changes that.

I can just ask it to re-write a rude thought in a professional and polite way.

Let's try it:

Job saved, phew!

The invention of the calculator had similar effects. Yes, we still teach math in school, but the reality of it is that most of us only require the most rudimentary math skills in our day-to-day. And for anything we can't do in our head, we're going to pull out our phone and use the calculator, or ask Siri. 

Even before AI, the education system has a lot of overdue overhauling to do anyhow. But it won't be led by the government / public school system, and probably not by the universities either. It'll take an Elon Musk type (or Elon himself), that comes along and flips the system on it's head. There are already rumbles of that happening with after-school courses like https://www.synthesis.com/

But who knows how long that will take, and it'll likely only be available to upper-class families who can afford expensive provate schools. And this fast AI progression makes that extra tricky.

This all re-inforces my main goal for my kids' education - my priorities for them are not about going to the best schools and getting the best grades, but developing an interest in learning and an ability to learn on their own. Armed wiaht that, I believe they'll be fine.


### The internet and the consequences of AI

Then there's the discussion of how AI will affect the internet as a whole. Over the longer term, the effects will be incredibly dramatic, and the internet of today will probably not even be recognizable.

Even in the near-term the effects will be huge. Will will have to start changing our habits and behaviors online, and there's already a huge shift happening.

## Curious

If you could fold a piece of paper 42 times, it would be thick enough to [reach the moon](https://boundlessbrilliance.org/brilliant-blog/foldingpapertothemoon).
