<p>So when you think about success, shoot for the moon. The moon is reachable if you prioritize everything and put all of your energy into accomplishing the most important thing. Getting extraordinary results is all about creating a domino effect in your life. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00C1BHQXK&amp;location=129">129</a> ^ref-18630</p>

<p>The key is over time. Success is built sequentially. It’s one thing at a time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00C1BHQXK&amp;location=140">140</a> ^ref-6105</p>

<p>When everything feels urgent and important, everything seems equal. We become active and busy, but this doesn’t actually move us any closer to success. Activity is often unrelated to productivity, and busyness rarely takes care of business. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00C1BHQXK&amp;location=299">299</a> ^ref-15729</p>

<p>Instead of a to-do list, you need a success list—a list that is purposefully created around extraordinary results. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00C1BHQXK&amp;location=323">323</a> ^ref-2379</p>

<p>When you try to do too much at once, you can end up doing nothing well. Figure out what matters most in the moment and give it your undivided attention. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00C1BHQXK&amp;location=527">527</a> ^ref-15736</p>

<p>Success is actually a short race—a sprint fueled by discipline just long enough for habit to kick in and take over. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00C1BHQXK&amp;location=539">539</a> ^ref-49887</p>
<hr>
<p>you can become successful with less discipline than you think, for one simple reason: success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00C1BHQXK&amp;location=550">550</a> ^ref-23047</p>

<p>Foods that elevate blood sugar evenly over long periods, like complex carbohydrates and proteins, become the fuel of choice for high-achievers—literal proof that “you are what you eat. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00C1BHQXK&amp;location=690">690</a> ^ref-9395</p>

<p>To achieve an extraordinary result you must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands.

<hr>
<p>When you act on your priority, you’ll automatically go out of balance, giving more time to one thing over another. The challenge then doesn’t become one of not going out of balance, for in fact you must. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00C1BHQXK&amp;location=853">853</a> ^ref-58941</p>

<p>done. As with a stretch goal, you can start out by doing research and studying the lives of other high achievers. But you can’t stop there. In fact, your search has just begun.
