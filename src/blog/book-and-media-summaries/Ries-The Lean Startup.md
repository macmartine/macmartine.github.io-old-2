## Highlights
What makes these failures particularly painful is not just the economic damage done to individual employees, companies, and investors; they are also a colossal waste of our civilization’s most precious resource: the time, passion, and skill of its people. — location: [260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=260) ^ref-51885

---
Startups also have a true north, a destination in mind: creating a thriving and world-changing business. I call that a startup’s vision. To achieve that vision, startups employ a strategy, which includes a business model, a product road map, a point of view about partners and competitors, and ideas about who the customer will be. The product is the end result of this strategy (see the chart on this page). — location: [327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=327) ^ref-29823

---
A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty. — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=383) ^ref-49955

---
“We’ve generated $50 million in offerings that did not exist twelve months ago in the last year. Now it’s not one particular offering. It’s a combination of a whole bunch of innovation happening, but that’s the kind of stuff that’s creating some energy for us, that we think we can truly short-circuit the ramp by killing things that don’t make sense fast and doubling down on the ones that do. — location: [492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=492) ^ref-38684

---
In the Lean Startup model, we are rehabilitating learning with a concept I call validated learning. Validated learning is not after-the-fact rationalization or a good story designed to hide failure. It is a rigorous method for demonstrating progress when one is embedded in the soil of extreme uncertainty in which startups grow. Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future business prospects. It is more concrete, more accurate, and faster than market forecasting or classical business planning. It is the principal antidote to the lethal problem of achieving failure: successfully executing a plan that leads nowhere. — location: [522](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=522) ^ref-57950

---
Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste. — location: [661](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=661) ^ref-3141

---
In a manufacturing business, customers don’t care how the product is assembled, only that it works correctly. — location: [662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=662) ^ref-35953

---
The effort that is not absolutely necessary for learning what customers want can be eliminated. I call this validated learning because it is always demonstrated by positive improvements in the startup’s core metrics. — location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=680) ^ref-7162

---
desires. We adopted the view that our job was to find a synthesis between our vision and what customers would accept; it wasn’t to capitulate to what customers thought they wanted or to tell customers what they ought to want. — location: [694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=694) ^ref-35435

---
The more pertinent questions are “Should this product be built?” and “Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services? — location: [762](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=762) ^ref-63449

---
These are some of the questions teams struggle to answer if they have followed the “let’s just ship a product and see what happens” plan. I call this the “just do it” school of entrepreneurship after Nike’s famous slogan.1 Unfortunately, if the plan is to see what happens, a team is guaranteed to succeed—at seeing what happens—but won’t necessarily gain validated learning. This is one of the most important lessons of the scientific method: if you cannot fail, you cannot learn. — location: [772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=772) ^ref-29379

---
It begins with a clear hypothesis that makes predictions about what is supposed to happen. It then tests those predictions empirically. Just as scientific experimentation is informed by theory, startup experimentation is guided by the startup’s vision. The goal of every startup experiment is to discover how to build a sustainable business around that vision. — location: [778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=778) ^ref-22906

---
The first step would be to break down the grand vision into its component parts. The two most important assumptions entrepreneurs make are what I call the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis. — location: [838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=838) ^ref-24441

---
The point is not to find the average customer but to find early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback. — location: [852](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=852) ^ref-39025

---
Additional experiments can expand on this early feedback and learning. For example, if the growth model requires that a certain percentage of participants share their experiences with colleagues and encourage their participation, the degree to which that takes place can be tested even with a very small sample of people. If ten people complete the first experiment, how many do we expect to volunteer again? If they are asked to recruit a colleague, how many do we expect will do so? Remember that these are supposed to be the kinds of early adopters with the most to gain from the program. — location: [858](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=858) ^ref-37431

---
In the Lean Startup model, an experiment is more than just a theoretical inquiry; it is also a first product. If this or any other experiment is successful, it allows the manager to get started with his or her campaign: enlisting early adopters, adding employees to each further experiment or iteration, and eventually starting to build a product. By the time that product is ready to be distributed widely, it will already have established customers. It will have solved real problems and offer detailed specifications for what needs to be built. Unlike a traditional strategic planning or market research process, this specification will be rooted in feedback on what is working today rather than in anticipation of what might work tomorrow. — location: [874](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=874) ^ref-60025

---
As Cook says, “Success is not delivering a feature; success is learning how to solve the customer’s problem.”4 — location: [917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=917) ^ref-1664

---
treat the CFPB as an experiment, identify the elements of the plan that are assumptions rather than facts, and figure out ways to test them. — location: [954](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=954) ^ref-13927

---
Using these insights, we could build a minimum viable product and have the agency up and running—on a micro scale—long before the official plan was set in motion. — location: [955](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=955) ^ref-4280

---
At its heart, a startup is a catalyst that transforms ideas into products. As customers interact with those products, they generate feedback and data. The feedback is both qualitative (such as what they like and don’t like) and quantitative (such as how many people use it and find it valuable). — location: [1000](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1000) ^ref-59443

---
The truth is that none of these activities by itself is of paramount importance. Instead, we need to focus our energies on minimizing the total time through this feedback loop. This is the essence of steering a startup — location: [1010](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1010) ^ref-9376

---
by focusing our energies on validated learning, we can avoid much of the waste that plagues startups today. As in lean manufacturing, learning where and when to invest energy results in saving time and money. — location: [1014](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1014) ^ref-30429

---
To apply the scientific method to a startup, we need to identify which hypotheses to test. I call the riskiest elements of a startup’s plan, the parts on which everything depends, leap-of-faith assumptions. The two most important assumptions are the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis. These give rise to tuning variables that control a startup’s engine of growth. Each iteration of a startup is an attempt to rev this engine — location: [1016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1016) ^ref-20559

---
Once clear on these leap-of-faith assumptions, the first step is to enter the Build phase as quickly as possible with a minimum viable product (MVP). The MVP is that version of the product that enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with a minimum amount of effort and the least amount of development time. The minimum viable product lacks many features that may prove essential later on. However, in some ways, creating a MVP requires extra work: we must be able to measure its impact. — location: [1020](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1020) ^ref-43235

---
When we enter the Measure phase, the biggest challenge will be determining whether the product development efforts are leading to real progress. — location: [1025](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1025) ^ref-62938

---
The method I recommend is called innovation accounting, a quantitative approach that allows us to see whether our engine-tuning efforts are bearing fruit. It also allows us to create learning milestones, which are an alternative to traditional business and product milestones. Learning milestones are useful for entrepreneurs as a way of assessing their progress accurately and objectively; they are also invaluable to managers and investors who must hold entrepreneurs accountable. — location: [1027](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1027) ^ref-31677

---
Finally, and most important, there’s the pivot — location: [1033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1033) ^ref-20966

---
If we’ve discovered that one of our hypotheses is false, it is time to make a major change to a new strategic hypothesis. — location: [1034](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1034) ^ref-2990

---
For startups, the role of strategy is to help figure out the right questions to ask. — location: [1068](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1068) ^ref-38927

---
Because the assumptions haven’t been proved to be true (they are assumptions, after all) and in fact are often erroneous, the goal of a startup’s early efforts should be to test them as quickly as possible. — location: [1071](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1071) ^ref-11453

---
The first challenge for an entrepreneur is to build an organization that can test these assumptions systematically. — location: [1074](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1074) ^ref-29383

---
What differentiates the success stories from the failures is that the successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the tools to discover which parts of their plans were working brilliantly and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly. — location: [1120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1120) ^ref-18807

---
The first step in understanding a new product or service is to figure out if it is fundamentally value-creating or value-destroying. — location: [1124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1124) ^ref-24942

---
The goal of such early contact with customers is not to gain definitive answers. Instead, it is to clarify at a basic, coarse level that we understand our potential customer and what problems they have. With that understanding, we can craft a customer archetype, a brief document that seeks to humanize the proposed target customer. This archetype is an essential guide for product development and ensures that the daily prioritization decisions that every product team must make are aligned with the customer to whom the company aims to appeal. — location: [1189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1189) ^ref-23715

---
A minimum viable product (MVP) helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible.3 It is not necessarily the smallest product imaginable, though; it is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort. — location: [1234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1234) ^ref-63464

---
Contrary to traditional product development, which usually involves a long, thoughtful incubation period and strives for product perfection, the goal of the MVP is to begin the process of learning, not end it. Unlike a prototype or concept test, an MVP is designed not just to answer product design or technical questions. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses. — location: [1237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1237) ^ref-24574

---
Early adopters are suspicious of something that is too polished: if it’s ready for everyone to adopt, how much advantage can one get by being early? — location: [1257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1257) ^ref-64026

---
most entrepreneurs and product development people dramatically overestimate how many features are needed in an MVP. When in doubt, simplify. — location: [1267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1267) ^ref-56296

---
how many features do we really need to include to appeal to early adopters? Every extra feature is a form of waste, and if we delay the test for these extra features, it comes with a tremendous potential cost in terms of learning and cycle time. — location: [1279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1279) ^ref-2402

---
The challenge was that it was impossible to demonstrate the working software in a prototype form. The product required that they overcome significant technical hurdles; it also had an online service component that required high reliability and availability. To avoid the risk of waking up after years of development with a product nobody wanted, Drew did something unexpectedly easy: he made a video. — location: [1304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1304) ^ref-799

---
In a concierge MVP, this personalized service is not the product but a learning activity designed to test the leap-of-faith assumptions in the company’s growth model. — location: [1361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1361) ^ref-47991

In a Wizard of Oz test, customers believe they are interacting with the actual product, but behind the scenes human beings are doing the work. — location: [1412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1412) ^ref-42777

---
If we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is. — location: [1431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1431) ^ref-15126

---
MVPs require the courage to put one’s assumptions to the test. — location: [1458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1458) ^ref-12807

---
As you consider building your own minimum viable product, let this simple rule suffice: remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek. — location: [1466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1466) ^ref-20811

---
Part of the special challenge of being a startup is the near impossibility of having your idea, company, or product be noticed by anyone, let alone a competitor. — location: [1481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1481) ^ref-32729

---
The truth is that most managers in most companies are already overwhelmed with good ideas. Their challenge lies in prioritization and execution, and it is those challenges that give a startup hope of surviving.10 — location: [1484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1484) ^ref-7585

---
The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else. — location: [1491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1491) ^ref-9307

---
Similarly, entrepreneurs in existing organizations often are constrained by the fear of damaging the parent company’s established brand. In either of these cases, there is an easy solution: launch the MVP under a different brand name. — location: [1492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1492) ^ref-5504

---
But startups have the advantage of being obscure, having a pathetically small number of customers, and not having much exposure. Rather than lamenting them, use these advantages to experiment under the radar and then do a public marketing launch once the product has proved itself with real customers.11 — location: [1495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1495) ^ref-4647

---
A startup’s job is to (1) rigorously measure where it is right now, confronting the hard truths that assessment reveals, and then (2) devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to the ideal reflected in the business plan. — location: [1525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1525) ^ref-26349

---
Innovation accounting enables startups to prove objectively that they are learning how to grow a sustainable business. Innovation accounting begins by turning the leap-of-faith assumptions discussed in Chapter 5 into a quantitative financial model. — location: [1552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1552) ^ref-49147

---
Innovation accounting works in three steps: first, use a minimum viable product to establish real data on where the company is right now. — location: [1570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1570) ^ref-15598

---
Second, startups must attempt to tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal. — location: [1572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1572) ^ref-42050

---
After the startup has made all the micro changes and product optimizations it can to move its baseline toward the ideal, the company reaches a decision point. That is the third step: pivot or persevere. — location: [1573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1573) ^ref-46914

---
When a company pivots, it starts the process all over again, reestablishing a new baseline and then tuning the engine from there. The sign of a successful pivot is that these engine-tuning activities are more productive after the pivot than before. — location: [1576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1576) ^ref-30893

---
This single MVP would test most of the startup’s assumptions and establish baseline metrics for each assumption simultaneously. — location: [1580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1580) ^ref-23933

---
These MVPs provide the first example of a learning milestone. An MVP allows a startup to fill in real baseline data in its growth model—conversion rates, sign-up and trial rates, customer lifetime value, and so on—and this is valuable as the foundation for learning about customers and their reactions to a product even if that foundation begins with extremely bad news. — location: [1585](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1585) ^ref-37708

---
When one is choosing among the many assumptions in a business plan, it makes sense to test the riskiest assumptions first. — location: [1588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1588) ^ref-33434

---
Once the baseline has been established, the startup can work toward the second learning milestone: tuning the engine. Every product development, marketing, or other initiative that a startup undertakes should be targeted at improving one of the drivers of its growth model. — location: [1595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1595) ^ref-58316

---
This is an important rule: a good design is one that changes customer behavior for the better. — location: [1600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1600) ^ref-7807

---
To read the graph, you need to understand something called cohort analysis. This is one of the most important tools of startup analytics. — location: [1636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1636) ^ref-18676

---
Managers with an enterprise sales background will recognize this funnel analysis as the traditional sales funnel that is used to manage prospects on their way to becoming customers. Lean Startups use it in product development, too. This technique is useful in many types of business, because every company depends for its survival on sequences of customer behavior called flows. — location: [1642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1642) ^ref-9220

---
Customer flows govern the interaction of customers with a company’s products. They allow us to understand a business quantitatively and have much more predictive power than do traditional gross metrics. — location: [1644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1644) ^ref-16263

---
In fact, this is the sign of a successful pivot: the new experiments you run are overall more productive than the experiments you were running before. — location: [1670](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1670) ^ref-48584

---
Companies of any size that have a working engine of growth can come to rely on the wrong kind of metrics to guide their actions. — location: [1707](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1707) ^ref-47552

---
Innovation accounting will not work if a startup is being misled by these kinds of vanity metrics: gross number of customers and so on. The alternative is the kind of metrics we use to judge our business and our learning milestones, what I call actionable metrics — location: [1725](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1725) ^ref-29556

---
For each sprint, Farb would prioritize the work to be done that month by writing a series of user stories, a technique taken from agile development. Instead of writing a specification for a new feature that described it in technical terms, Farb would write a story that described the feature from the point of view of the customer. That story helped keep the engineers focused on the customer’s perspective throughout the development process. — location: [1762](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1762) ^ref-45261

---
A split-test experiment is one in which different versions of a product are offered to customers at the same time. By observing the changes in behavior between the two groups, one can make inferences about the impact of the different variations. This technique was pioneered by direct mail advertisers. — location: [1818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1818) ^ref-4585

---
Although working with split tests seems to be more difficult because it requires extra accounting and metrics to keep track of each variation, it almost always saves tremendous amounts of time in the long run by eliminating work that doesn’t matter to customers. — location: [1829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1829) ^ref-4066

---
Under the new system, user stories were not considered complete until they led to validated learning. — location: [1842](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1842) ^ref-16110

---
Thus, stories could be cataloged as being in one of four states of development: in the product backlog, actively being built, done (feature complete from a technical point of view), or in the process of being validated. Validated was defined as “knowing whether the story was a good idea to have been done in the first place.” This validation usually would come in the form of a split test showing a change in customer behavior but also might include customer interviews or surveys. — location: [1843](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1843) ^ref-34489

B and C have been built, but under kanban, cannot be moved to the next bucket for validation until A, D, E have been validated. Work cannot begin on H and I until space opens up in the buckets ahead. — location: [1857](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1857) ^ref-8000

Think about this. Think about the cohort of customers who were required to register for the product before entering a study session with other students. They had very little information about the product, nothing more than was presented on Grockit’s home page and registration page. By contrast, the lazy registration group had a tremendous amount of information about the product because they had used it. Yet despite this information disparity, customer behavior was exactly the same. This suggested that improving Grockit’s positioning and marketing might have a more significant impact on attracting new customers than would adding new features. — location: [1893](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1893) ^ref-45359

For a report to be considered actionable, it must demonstrate clear cause and effect. Otherwise, it is a vanity metric. — location: [1905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1905) ^ref-21110

---
The easiest way to make reports comprehensible is to use tangible, concrete units. What is a website hit? Nobody is really sure, but everyone knows what a person visiting the website is: one can practically picture those people sitting at their computers. — location: [1927](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1927) ^ref-46547

---
This is why cohort-based reports are the gold standard of learning metrics: — location: [1929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1929) ^ref-48631

---
Instead of housing the analytics or data in a separate system, our reporting data and its infrastructure were considered part of the product itself and were owned by the product development team. The reports were available on our website, accessible to anyone with an employee account. — location: [1943](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1943) ^ref-37419

---
Each employee could log in to the system at any time, choose from a list of all current and past experiments, and see a simple one-page summary of the results. Over time, those one-page summaries became the de facto standard for settling product arguments throughout the organization. — location: [1945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1945) ^ref-59081

Only 5 percent of entrepreneurship is the big idea, the business model, the whiteboard strategizing, and the splitting up of the spoils. The other 95 percent is the gritty work that is measured by innovation accounting: product prioritization decisions, deciding which customers to target or listen to, and having the courage to subject a grand vision to constant testing and feedback. — location: [1974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=1974) ^ref-30102

He has plenty of learning that he can use to rationalize the failure he has experienced with the current product. That’s exactly what many entrepreneurs do. In Silicon Valley, we call this experience getting stuck in the land of the living dead.

Remember that the rationale for building low-quality MVPs is that developing any features beyond what early adopters require is a form of waste. However, the logic of this takes you only so far. Once you have found success with early adopters, you want to sell to mainstream customers. Mainstream customers have different requirements and are much more demanding. — location: [2285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2285) ^ref-27492

The kind of pivot we needed is called a customer segment pivot. In this pivot, the company realizes that the product it’s building solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the customers it originally planned to serve. In other words, the product hypothesis is confirmed only partially. — location: [2288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2288) ^ref-8106

The father won the race, and not just because he is an adult. It happened because the one envelope at a time approach is a faster way of getting the job done even though it seems inefficient. This has been confirmed in many studies, including one that was recorded on video.1 — location: [2445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2445) ^ref-30243

The one envelope at a time approach is called “single-piece flow” in lean manufacturing. — location: [2448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2448) ^ref-10139

---
Why does stuffing one envelope at a time get the job done faster even though it seems like it would be slower? Because our intuition doesn’t take into account the extra time required to sort, stack, and move around the large piles of half-complete envelopes when it’s done the other way.2 It seems more efficient to repeat the same task over and over, in part because we expect that we will get better at this simple task the more we do it. Unfortunately, in process-oriented work like this, individual performance is not nearly as important as the overall performance of the system. — location: [2452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2452) ^ref-37693

---
Even if the amount of time that each process took was exactly the same, the small batch production approach still would be superior, and for even more counterintuitive reasons. For example, imagine that the letters didn’t fit in the envelopes. With the large-batch approach, we wouldn’t find that out until nearly the end. With small batches, we’d know almost immediately. What if the envelopes are defective and won’t seal? In the large-batch approach, we’d have to unstuff all the envelopes, get new ones, and restuff them. In the small-batch approach, we’d find this out immediately and have no rework required. — location: [2456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2456) ^ref-5498

Because of its smaller batch size, Toyota was able to produce a much greater diversity of products. It was no longer necessary that each product be exactly the same to gain the economies of scale that powered mass production. Thus, Toyota could serve its smaller, more fragmented markets and still compete with the mass producers. Over time, that capability allowed Toyota to move successfully into larger and larger markets until it became the world’s largest automaker in 2008. — location: [2481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2481) ^ref-16535

Toyota discovered that small batches made their factories more efficient. In contrast, in the Lean Startup the goal is not to produce more stuff efficiently. It is to—as quickly as possible—learn how to build a sustainable business. — location: [2494](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2494) ^ref-42623

---
In manufacturing, pull is used primarily to make sure production processes are tuned to levels of customer demand. Without this, factories can wind up making much more—or much less—of a product than customers really want. However, applying this approach to developing new products is not straightforward. Some people misunderstand the Lean Startup model as simply applying pull to customer wants. This assumes that customers could tell us what products to build and that this would act as the pull signal to product development to make them.9 — location: [2676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2676) ^ref-52077

---
As soon as we formulate a hypothesis that we want to test, the product development team should be engineered to design and run this experiment as quickly as possible, using the smallest batch size that will get the job done. Remember that although we write the feedback loop as Build-Measure-Learn because the activities happen in that order, our planning really works in the reverse order: we figure out what we need to learn and then work backwards to see what product will work as an experiment to get that learning. — location: [2683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2683) ^ref-50480

---
Thus, it is not the customer, but rather our hypothesis about the customer, that pulls work from product development and other functions. Any other work is waste. — location: [2687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2687) ^ref-21369

The engine of growth is the mechanism that startups use to achieve sustainable growth. — location: [2753](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2753) ^ref-52569

---
I use the word sustainable to exclude all one-time activities that generate a surge of customers but have no long-term impact, such as a single advertisement or a publicity stunt that might be used to jump-start growth but could not sustain that growth for the long term. Sustainable growth is characterized by one simple rule: New customers come from the actions of past customers. — location: [2754](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2754) ^ref-18670

There are four primary ways past customers drive sustainable growth: — location: [2758](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2758) ^ref-52533

There are always a zillion new ideas about how to make the product better floating around, but the hard truth is that most of those ideas make a difference only at the margins. They are mere optimizations. Startups have to focus on the big experiments that lead to validated learning. The engines of growth framework helps them stay focused on the metrics that matter. — location: [2781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2781) ^ref-58029

Therefore, companies using the sticky engine of growth track their attrition rate or churn rate very carefully. — location: [2798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2798) ^ref-56287

grow. The speed of growth is determined by what I call the rate of compounding, which is simply the natural growth rate minus the churn rate. — location: [2801](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2801) ^ref-36759

Either way, its focus needs to be on improving customer retention. This goes against the standard intuition in that if a company lacks growth, it should invest more in sales and marketing. This counterintuitive result is hard to infer from standard vanity metrics. — location: [2816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2816) ^ref-64632

---
Like the other engines of growth, the viral engine is powered by a feedback loop that can be quantified. It is called the viral loop, and its speed is determined by a single mathematical term called the viral coefficient. The higher this coefficient is, the faster the product will spread. The viral coefficient measures how many new customers will use a product as a consequence of each new customer who signs up. Put another way, how many friends will each customer bring with him or her? Since each friend is also a new customer, he or she has an opportunity to recruit yet more friends. — location: [2835](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2835) ^ref-53825

---
Companies that rely on the viral engine of growth must focus on increasing the viral coefficient more than anything else, because even tiny changes in this number will cause dramatic changes in their future prospects. — location: [2845](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2845) ^ref-6395

---
However, it is not true that customers do not give these companies something of value: by investing their time and attention in the product, they make the product valuable to advertisers. — location: [2853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2853) ^ref-34720

---
If either company wants to increase its rate of growth, it can do so in one of two ways: increase the revenue from each customer or drive down the cost of acquiring a new customer. — location: [2865](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2865) ^ref-22672

---
Suppose an advertisement costs $100 and causes fifty new customers to sign up for the service. This ad has a cost per acquisition (CPA) of $2.00. In this example, if the product has an LTV that is greater than $2, the product will grow. The margin between the LTV and the CPA determines how fast the paid engine of growth will turn (this is called the marginal profit). — location: [2878](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2878) ^ref-30730

---
However, in my experience, successful startups usually focus on just one engine of growth, specializing in everything that is required to make it work. — location: [2910](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2910) ^ref-53148

---
Therefore, I strongly recommend that startups focus on one engine at a time. — location: [2912](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2912) ^ref-60464

Most entrepreneurs already have a strong leap-of-faith hypothesis about which engine is most likely to work.

A startup can evaluate whether it is getting closer to product/market fit as it tunes its engine by evaluating each trip through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop using innovation accounting. What really matters is not the raw numbers or vanity metrics but the direction and degree of progress. — location: [2937](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2937) ^ref-5196

Even with no insight into these two companies’ gross numbers, we can tell that company A is making real progress whereas company B is stuck in the mud. This is true even though company B is growing faster than company A right now. — location: [2949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2949) ^ref-1289

---
Following that strategy successfully will unlock an engine of growth that can reach that target audience. However, making the transition to mainstream customers will require tremendous additional work. — location: [2956](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=2956) ^ref-23414

On the other hand, the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop is a continuous process. We don’t stop after one minimum viable product but use what we have learned to get to work immediately on the next iteration. — location: [3030](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=3030) ^ref-33239

Adaptive processes force you to slow down and invest in preventing the kinds of problems that are currently wasting time. As those preventive efforts pay off, you naturally speed up again. — location: [3044](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=3044) ^ref-3936

Let me demonstrate how using the Five Whys allowed us to build the employee training system that was mentioned earlier. Imagine that at IMVU we suddenly start receiving complaints from customers about a new version of the product that we have just released. — location: [3074](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=3074) ^ref-54316

---
Here’s how to use Five Whys analysis to build an adaptive organization: consistently make a proportional investment at each of the five levels of the hierarchy. In other words, the investment should be smaller when the symptom is minor and larger when the symptom is more painful. We don’t make large investments in prevention unless we’re coping with large problems. In the example above, the answer is to fix the server, change the subsystem to make it less error-prone, educate the engineer, and, yes, have a conversation with the engineer’s manager. — location: [3083](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004J4XGN6&location=3083) ^ref-1218
