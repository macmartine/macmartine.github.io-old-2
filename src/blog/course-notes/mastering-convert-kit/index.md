## Differences between automation rules and visual automations

### Automation triggers:

If added to sequences, they stay in that sequence. So if new emails are added well after someone went through that sequence, they'll still get it.

This is not the case with visual automations - the person is no longer in that sequence after they complete it

Setting custom field data when in automation rule, cannot use liquid 

### Starting visual automation from another visual automation

When you do this, the first visual automation does not wait for the other to complete. So if you want it to wait, you need to set a tag in the other one, once it's done. Then in the first one set it just continue when that tag is set

### Delays

Automation rules are immediate

So even if a sequence is set to go out at a certain time, the first will go out immediately when that sequence is triggered.

With visual automations the delay is always relative to the previous thing. Effectively the same thing as delaying for 24 hours.


## Segmentation

Questions asked:
- What stage are you in? (WHO)
- What stage are you in now? (NOW)
- Explain deficiencies (WHY)
- Describe your ideal business/outcome (TOMORROW)

Segmentation goals:

Stage
- Looking for idea
- Have idea, haven't started
- Development
- < $10k revenue
- > $10k revenue
- Onlooker

Why they feel they are being held back
- Can't find idea
- No time, etc...

Find out their #1, not multiple answers
