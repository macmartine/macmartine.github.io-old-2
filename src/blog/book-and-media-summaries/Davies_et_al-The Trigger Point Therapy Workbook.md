## Highlights
The resulting oxygen starvation and accumulation of the waste products of metabolism cause even more muscle fibers to contract (Sikdar et al. 2009). This is also why nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not effective in the treatment of trigger points — location: [590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=590) ^ref-20390

Satellite trigger points often resolve without treatment when the primary trigger point is deactivated. By the same token, satellites can be difficult if not impossible to deactivate if the primary trigger point is overlooked. — location: [691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=691) ^ref-49204

The long, overstretched muscles are the “victims” of the real troublemakers, the short tight muscles. You will find that treating only the crying trigger points won’t solve the problem. Massage of the short, tight opposing muscles and their trigger points will actually be more productive — location: [707](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=707) ^ref-63974

Flexion is the term used to describe a decrease in the angle of a joint. For example, the biceps muscle, on the front of the upper arm, flexes, or “bends,” the elbow, thus decreasing the joint angle from about 180 degrees to about 40 degrees. The triceps on the back of the upper arm extends, or makes larger, the angle. Once you identify which muscles are shortening the angle and putting the symptomatic muscles on a stretch, massage the muscles that are doing the shortening; these are the mechanical “perpetrators.” — location: [712](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=712) ^ref-4350

Generally, if someone wants you to stretch a muscle, it is usually a good idea to massage its trigger points first. — location: [721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=721) ^ref-23870

Here are some examples of long, over-stretched muscles at odds with short, tight muscles: rhomboids versus pectoralis major infraspinatus and teres minor versus subscapularis and pectoralis major — location: [722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=722) ^ref-34349

Within your musculoskeletal system, the direction of pain referral from a trigger point is almost always—about 85 percent of the time, in fact—away from the center of the body. — location: [745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=745) ^ref-62011

---
Permanent postural change can be accomplished with the assistance of trigger point massage, stretching, and then targeted exercise to strengthen the opposing overstretched muscles — location: [827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=827) ^ref-50210

The upper trigger point is an extremely common primary trigger point. It refers pain to back of the neck and base of the skull like the trigger points in the upper trapezius. It’s one of the many causes of a stiff neck. It can also send referred pain to the upper trapezius itself. — location: [1920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=1920) ^ref-48180

You may be told your symptoms are from spinal disk compression, spinal stenosis, bursitis of the shoulder, or neuralgia. — location: [1943](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=1943) ^ref-58608

At the computer or any other desk job, use a chair with arms whenever possible. It’s not enough to rest your arms on the desk. — location: [1961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=1961) ^ref-25692

Carrying a heavy backpack or a heavy purse hanging from a shoulder strap can be the simple explanation for that recurring migraine or chronically stiff neck — location: [1963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=1963) ^ref-46120

Trigger points in these two muscles, along with those in the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles, account for much of the pain in the jaw, — location: [2225](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00ECLGALG&location=2225) ^ref-23427
