<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>To teach these, I have developed a framework called the Six Ds of Exponentials: digitalization, deception, disruption, demonetization, dematerialization, and democratization. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=218">218</a> ^ref-6222</p>

<p>Of course, it’s not just Kodak. Anything that becomes digitized (biology, medicine, manufacturing, and so forth) hops on Moore’s law of increasing computational power.10 Thus the first of our Ds is digitalization, for the simple reason that once a process or product transitions from physical to digital, it becomes exponentially empowered. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=231">231</a> ^ref-65324</p>

<p>Nor is it just economists or, for that matter, Kodak executives. Skype demonetized long-distance telephony; Craigslist demonetized classified advertising; Napster demonetized the music industry. This list goes on and on. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=275">275</a> ^ref-38625</p>

<p>Welcome to the New Kodak Moment—the moment when an exponential force puts a linear company out of business. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=414">414</a> ^ref-55457</p>

<p>A Quirky user simply posts his or her product idea to the site, where other users vote on its feasibility and desirability. And what the crowd likes, the crowd builds, one crowdsourced, open-sourced step at a time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=441">441</a> ^ref-44667</p>

<p>The goal here is not to teach you how to become Ben Kaufman, it’s to teach you to harness exponential platforms like Quirky, or to encourage you to create similar platforms yourself. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=454">454</a> ^ref-37371</p>

<p>Most recently the company was valued at $10 billion—making it worth more than Hyatt Hotels Corporation ($8.4 billion)—and all without building a single structure.24 — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=473">473</a> ^ref-3831</p>

<p>But imagine being able to take your knowledge of what computers can do today back to the early 1980s—what bold entrepreneurial business opportunities might this have unlocked for you? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=536">536</a> ^ref-46752</p>

<p>Recognizing when a technology is exiting the trough of disillusionment and beginning to rise up the slope of enlightenment is critical for entrepreneurs. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=540">540</a> ^ref-1286</p>

<p>Reading an exponential curve like a road map, experts watch for a number of indicators—the development of best practices, supplier proliferation, secondary financings, among others. But for me, the most important telltale factor is the development of a simple and elegant user interface—a gateway of effortless interaction that plucks a technology from the hands of the geeks and deposits it with the entrepreneurs. In fact, it was exactly this kind of interface that transformed the Internet. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=541">541</a> ^ref-26278</p>

<p>Fast-forward five years to mid-2013, when Google paid $1 billion to acquire Waze, an Israeli-based company that generates maps and traffic information, not via electronic sensors, but instead via crowdsourced user reports—i.e., human sensors, generating maps by using GPS to track the movements of some 50 million users, then generating traffic-flow data as those users voluntarily share information about slowdowns, speed traps, and road closures in real time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LD1RZGM&amp;location=826">826</a> ^ref-60661</p>
