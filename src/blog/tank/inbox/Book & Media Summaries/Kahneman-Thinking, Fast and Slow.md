## Highlights
We found that people, when engaged in a mental sprint, may become effectively blind. The authors of The Invisible Gorilla had made the gorilla “invisible” by keeping the observers intensely busy counting passes. — location: [495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=495) ^ref-12165

Much like the electricity meter outside your house or apartment, the pupils offer an index of the current rate at which mental energy is used. The analogy goes deep. Your use of electricity depends on — location: [504](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=504) ^ref-31205

---
As you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes. Studies of the brain have shown that the pattern of activity associated with an action changes as skill increases, with fewer brain regions involved. Talent has similar effects. Highly intelligent individuals need less effort to solve the same problems, as indicated by both pupil size and brain activity. — location: [522](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=522) ^ref-58491

One of the significant discoveries of cognitive psychologists in recent decades is that switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure. — location: [554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=554) ^ref-47213

Accelerating beyond my strolling speed completely changes the experience of walking, because the transition to a faster walk brings about a sharp deterioration in my ability to think coherently. — location: [594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=594) ^ref-6393

An observer of the number of times I look at e-mail or investigate the refrigerator during an hour of writing could reasonably infer an urge to escape and conclude that keeping at it requires more self-control than I can readily muster. Fortunately, cognitive work is not always aversive, and people sometimes expend considerable effort for long periods of time without having to exert willpower. The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced six-cent-mihaly) has done more than anyone else to study this state of effortless attending, and the name he proposed for it, flow, has become part of the language. People who experience flow describe it as “a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems,” and their descriptions of the joy of that state are so compelling that Csikszentmihalyi has called it an “optimal experience.” Many activities can induce a sense of flow, from painting to racing motorcycles—and for some fortunate authors I know, even writing a book is often an optimal experience. Flow neatly separates the two forms of effort: concentration on the task and the deliberate control of attention. Riding a motorcycle at 150 miles an hour and playing a competitive game of chess are certainly very effortful. In a state of flow, however, maintaining focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand. — location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=602) ^ref-22333

System 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy, and it has a sweet tooth. — location: [619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=619) ^ref-11375

---
The conclusion is straightforward: self-control requires attention and effort. Another way of saying this is that controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs. — location: [624](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=624) ^ref-27192

A series of surprising experiments by the psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues has shown conclusively that all variants of voluntary effort—cognitive, emotional, or physical—draw at least partly on a shared pool of mental energy. Their experiments involve successive rather than simultaneous tasks. — location: [625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=625) ^ref-43166

The bold implication of this idea is that the effects of ego depletion could be undone by ingesting glucose, and Baumeister and his colleagues have confirmed this hypothesis in several experiments. — location: [652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=652) ^ref-12635

---
It will take some time and much further research to establish whether the tasks that cause glucose-depletion also cause the momentary arousal that is reflected in increases of pupil size and heart rate. — location: [661](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=661) ^ref-13112

problem. The extent of deliberate checking and search is a characteristic of System 2, which varies among individuals. — location: [715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=715) ^ref-57189

troubling. “Lazy” is a harsh judgment about the self-monitoring of these young people and their System 2, but it does not seem to be unfair. Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called “engaged.” They are more alert, more intellectually active, less willing to be satisfied with superficially attractive answers, more skeptical about their intuitions. — location: [720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=720) ^ref-30743

intuitions. Individuals who uncritically follow their intuitions about puzzles are also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. In particular, they are impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate gratification. — location: [749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=749) ^ref-13008

---
System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy. We recognize related differences among individuals: some people are more like their System 2; others are closer to their System 1. This simple test has emerged as one of the better predictors of lazy thinking. — location: [754](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=754) ^ref-40722

Some people are better than others in these tasks of brain power—they are the individuals who excel in intelligence tests and are able to switch from one task to another quickly and efficiently. However, Stanovich argues that high intelligence does not make people immune to biases. Another ability is involved, which he labels rationality. Stanovich’s concept of a rational person is similar to what I earlier labeled “engaged.” The core of his argument is that rationality should be distinguished from intelligence. In his view, superficial or “lazy” thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality. This is an attractive and thought-provoking idea. — location: [762](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=762) ^ref-7461

---
In support of it, Stanovich and his colleagues have found that the bat-and-ball question and others like it are somewhat better indicators of our susceptibility to cognitive errors than are conventional measures of intelligence, such as IQ tests. Time will tell whether the distinction between intelligence and rationality can lead to new discoveries. — location: [767](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=767) ^ref-20321
