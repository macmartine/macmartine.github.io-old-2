<p>The choice-obsessed modern West is probably more accommodating to individuals who choose to eat differently than any culture has ever been, but ironically, the utterly unselective omnivore — “I’m easy; I’ll eat anything” — can appear more socially sensitive than the individual who tries to eat in a way that is good for society. Food choices are determined by many factors, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=389">389</a> ^ref-47899</p>

<p>Beyond this literal forgetting of animals by eating them, animal bodies were, for Kafka, burdened with the forgetting of all those parts of ourselves we want to forget. If we wish to disavow a part of our nature, we call it our “animal nature.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=462">462</a> ^ref-54298</p>

<p>I felt shame for living in a nation of unprecedented prosperity — a nation that spends a smaller percentage of income on food than any other civilization has in human history — but in the name of affordability treats the animals it eats with cruelty so extreme it would be illegal if inflicted on a dog. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=508">508</a> ^ref-22349</p>

<p>by controlling the light, the feed, and when they eat, the industry can force the birds to lay eggs year-round. So that’s what they do. Turkey hens now lay 120 eggs a year and chickens lay over 300. That’s two or even three times as many as in nature. After that first year, they are killed because they won’t lay as many eggs in the second year — the industry figured out that it’s cheaper to slaughter them and start over than it is feed and house birds that lay fewer eggs. These practices are a big part of why poultry meat is so cheap today, but the birds suffer for it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=747">747</a> ^ref-17372</p>

<p>Having little exposure to animals makes it much easier to push aside questions about how our actions might influence their treatment. The problem posed by meat has become an abstract one: there is no individual animal, no singular look of joy or suffering, no wagging tail, and no scream. The philosopher Elaine Scarry has observed that “beauty always takes place in the particular.” Cruelty, on the other hand, prefers abstraction. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=1300">1300</a> ^ref-21164</p>

<p>Despite these trends in processing, at the dawn of the twentieth century, animals were still largely raised on farms and ranches in much the same manner they always had been — and as most people continue to imagine.

<p>For each food animal species, animal agriculture is now dominated by the factory farm — 99.9 percent of chickens raised for meat, 97 percent of laying hens, 99 percent of turkeys, 95 percent of pigs, and 78 percent of cattle — but there are still some vibrant alternatives. In the pig industry, small farmers have begun to work cooperatively to preserve themselves. And the movements toward sustainable fishing and cattle ranching have captured significant press and market share. But the transformation of the poultry industry — the largest and most influential in animal agriculture (99 percent of all land animals slaughtered are farmed birds) — is all but complete. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=1399">1399</a> ^ref-18540</p>

<p>Not a single turkey you can buy in a supermarket could walk normally, much less jump or fly. Did you know that? They can’t even have sex. Not the antibiotic-free, or organic, or free-range, or anything. They all have the same foolish genetics, and their bodies won’t allow for it anymore. Every turkey sold in every store and served in every restaurant was the product of artificial insemination. If it were only for efficiency, that would be one thing, but these animals literally can’t reproduce naturally. Tell me what could be sustainable about that? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=1420">1420</a> ^ref-58815</p>

<p>Just the other day, one of the local pediatricians was telling me he’s seeing all kinds of illnesses that he never used to see. Not only juvenile diabetes, but inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that a lot of the docs don’t even know what to call. And girls are going through puberty much earlier, and kids are allergic to just about everything, and asthma is out of control. Everyone knows it’s our food. We’re messing with the genes of these animals and then feeding them growth hormones and all kinds of drugs that we really don’t know enough about. And then we’re eating them. Kids today are the first generation to grow up on this stuff, and we’re making a science experiment out of them. Isn’t it strange how upset people get about a few dozen baseball players taking growth hormones, when we’re doing what we’re doing to our food animals and feeding them to our children? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=1437">1437</a> ^ref-20279</p>

<p>there is scientific consensus that new viruses, which move between farmed animals and humans, will be a major global health threat into the foreseeable future.

<p>Today the best evidence suggests that the avian source of the 1968 pandemic is not unique: scientists now argue that the primordial source of all flu strains is migrating aquatic birds such as ducks and geese that have roamed the earth for more than a hundred million years.

<p>consumers might notice that their chickens don’t taste quite right — how good could a drug-stuffed, disease-ridden, shit-contaminated animal possibly taste? — but the birds will be injected (or otherwise pumped up) with “broths” and salty solutions to give them what we have come to think of as the chicken look, smell, and taste. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=1626">1626</a> ^ref-5609</p>

<p>chicken factory farms — well run or poorly run, “cage-free” or not — are basically the same: all birds come from similar Frankenstein-like genetic stock; all are confined; none enjoy the breeze or the warmth of sunlight; none are able to fulfill all (or usually any) of their species-specific behaviors like nesting, perching, exploring their environment, and forming stable social units; illness is always rampant; suffering is always the rule; the animals are always only a unit, a weight; death is invariably cruel.

<p>the factory farm industry (in alliance with the pharmaceutical industry) currently has more power than public-health professionals. The source of the industry’s immense power is not obscure.

<p>Consider, for example, the National Dairy Council (NDC), a marketing arm of Dairy Management Inc., an industry body whose sole purpose, according to its website, is to “drive increased sales of and demand for U.S. dairy products.” The NDC promotes dairy consumption without regard for negative public-health consequences and even markets dairy to communities incapable of digesting the stuff. As it is a trade group, the NDC’s behavior is at least understandable. What is hard to comprehend is why educators and government have, since the 1950s, allowed the NDC to become arguably the largest and most important supplier of nutritional-education materials in the nation. Worse, our present federal “nutritional” guidelines come to us from the very same government department that has worked so hard to make factory farming the norm in America, the USDA. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=1825">1825</a> ^ref-27357</p>

<p>In a striking example of food industry influence, Nestle argues that the USDA currently has an informal policy to avoid saying that we should “eat less” of any food no matter how damaging its health impact may be.

<p>The most successful legal battles against hog factory farms in the United States have focused on their incredible potential to pollute. (When people talk about the environmental toll of animal agriculture, this is a large part of what they’re talking about.) The problem is quite simple: massive amounts of shit.

<p>most people never have to confront the unpleasant fact that animal foods (including dairy and eggs) involve killing animals. They remain disconnected from this reality, buying their meats, fish, and cheeses at restaurants and supermarkets, already cooked or presented to them in pieces, making it easy to give little or no thought to the animals these foods come from. This is a problem. It has enabled agribusiness to shift livestock and poultry farming into unhealthy, inhumane systems with little public scrutiny. Few people have seen the insides of industrial dairies, egg or pig operations, and most consumers truly have no idea what is going on at such places.

While early American ranchers kept cattle on the range for four or five years, today they are slaughtered at twelve to fourteen months. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=2887">2887</a> ^ref-24854</p>

<p>I couldn’t get near the inside of a large slaughter facility. Just about the only way for someone outside the industry to see industrial cattle slaughter is to go undercover, and that is not only a project that takes half a year or more, it can be life-threatening work. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=2905">2905</a> ^ref-63328</p>

<p>“Eating industrial meat takes an almost heroic act of not knowing, or, now, forgetting.” That heroism is needed precisely because one has to forget a lot more than the mere fact of animal deaths: one has to forget not only that animals are killed, but how. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=2916">2916</a> ^ref-55553</p>

<p>The USDA, the federal agency charged with enforcing humane slaughter, responded to these numbers not by stepping up enforcement, but by changing its policy to cease tracking the number of humane slaughter violations and removing any mention of humane slaughter from its list of rotating tasks for inspectors. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=2944">2944</a> ^ref-7231</p>

<p>Grandin’s most recent estimates — which optimistically rely on data from announced audits — still found one in four cattle slaughterhouses unable to reliably render animals unconscious on the first blow. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=2948">2948</a> ^ref-16519</p>

<p>The cows can get seven minutes down the line and still be alive. I’ve been in the side puller where they’re still alive. All the hide is stripped out down the neck there.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=2962">2962</a> ^ref-49827</p>

<p>Because the average farmer can’t run his own hatchery, concentrated industry control of genetics locks farmers and their animals into the factory system. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=3011">3011</a> ^ref-24360</p>

<p>Except they’re not exactly farmers anymore; they’re corporations. And these corporations are not simply business magnates (who are quite capable of conscience). They are usually massive corporations with legal obligations to maximize profitability. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=3040">3040</a> ^ref-27497</p>

<p>The factory farm has succeeded by divorcing people from their food, eliminating farmers, and ruling agriculture by corporate fiat. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=3049">3049</a> ^ref-59021</p>

<p>despite the pleasure we take in eating vast amounts, Thanksgiving is not about being gluttonous — it is about the opposite. Perhaps the turkey is there because it is fundamental to the ritual — it is how we celebrate Thanksgiving. Why? Because Pilgrims might have eaten it at their first Thanksgiving? It’s more likely that they didn’t. We know that they didn’t have corn, apples, potatoes, or cranberries, and the only two written reports from the legendary Thanksgiving at Plymouth mention venison and wildfowl. Though it’s conceivable that they ate wild turkey, we know that the turkey wasn’t made part of the ritual until the nineteenth century. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=3193">3193</a> ^ref-50951</p>

<p>But compassion is a muscle that gets stronger with use, and the regular exercise of choosing kindness over cruelty would change us. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002SSBD6W&amp;location=3306">3306</a> ^ref-45537</p>
