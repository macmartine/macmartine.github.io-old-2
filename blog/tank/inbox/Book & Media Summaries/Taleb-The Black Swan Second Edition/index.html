<p>Black Swan logic makes what you don’t know far more relevant than what you do know. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=302">302</a> ^ref-43294</p>

<p>Black Swans being unpredictable, we need to adjust to their existence (rather than naïvely try to predict them). There are so many things we can do if we focus on antiknowledge, or what we do not know. Among many other benefits, you can set yourself up to collect serendipitous Black Swans (of the positive kind) by maximizing your exposure to them. Indeed, in some domains—such as scientific discovery and venture capital investments—there is a disproportionate payoff from the unknown, since you typically have little to lose and plenty to gain from a rare event. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=330">330</a> ^ref-5603</p>

<p>I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=336">336</a> ^ref-25220</p>

<p>that I was hit with the idea of efficient markets—an idea that holds that there is no way to derive profits from traded securities since these instruments have automatically incorporated all the available information. Public information can therefore be useless, particularly to a businessman, since prices can already “include” all such information, and news shared with millions gives you no real advantage. Odds are that one or more of the hundreds of millions of other readers of such information will already have bought the security, thus pushing up the price. I then completely gave up reading newspapers — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=764">764</a> ^ref-23127</p>

<p>It did not even feel eerie. It felt like Lebanon, with a twist: having seen both, I was struck that financial distress could be more demoralizing than war (just consider that financial problems and the accompanying humiliations can lead to suicide, but war doesn’t appear to do so directly). — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=797">797</a> ^ref-2013</p>

<p>If I myself had to give advice, I would recommend someone pick a profession that is not scalable! A scalable profession is good only if you are successful; they are more competitive, produce monstrous inequalities, and are far more random, with huge disparities between efforts and rewards—a few can take a large share of the pie, leaving others out entirely at no fault of their own. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=971">971</a> ^ref-57919</p>

<p>By the same mechanism, the advent of the cinema displaced neighborhood actors, putting the small guys out of business. But there is a difference. In pursuits that have a technical component, like being a pianist or a brain surgeon, talent is easy to ascertain, with subjective opinion playing a relatively small part. The inequity comes when someone perceived as being marginally better gets the whole pie. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1006">1006</a> ^ref-12710</p>

<p>The success of movies depends severely on contagions. Such contagions do not just apply to the movies: they seem to affect a wide range of cultural products. It is hard for us to accept that people do not fall in love with works of art only for their own sake, but also in order to feel that they belong to a community. By imitating, we get closer to others—that is, other imitators. It fights solitude. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1012">1012</a> ^ref-20916</p>

<p>Whenever you hear a snotty (and frustrated) European middlebrow presenting his stereotypes about Americans, he will often describe them as “uncultured,” “unintellectual,” and “poor in math” because, unlike his peers, Americans are not into equation drills and the constructions middlebrows call “high culture”—like knowledge of Goethe’s inspirational (and central) trip to Italy, or familiarity with the Delft school of painting. Yet the person making these statements is likely to be addicted to his iPod, wear blue jeans, and use Microsoft Word to jot down his “cultural” statements on his PC, with some Google searches here and there interrupting his composition. Well, it so happens that America is currently far, far more creative than these nations of museumgoers and equation solvers. It is also far more tolerant of bottom-up tinkering and undirected trial and error. And globalization has allowed the United States to specialize in the creative aspect of things, the production of concepts and ideas, that is, the scalable part of the products, and, increasingly, by exporting jobs, separate the less scalable components and assign them to those happy to be paid by the hour. There is more money in designing a shoe than in actually making it: Nike, Dell, and Boeing can get paid for just thinking, organizing, and leveraging their know-how and ideas while subcontracted factories in developing countries do the grunt work and engineers in cultured and mathematical states do the noncreative technical grind. The American economy has leveraged itself heavily on the idea generation, which explains why losing manufacturing jobs can be coupled with a rising standard of living. Clearly the drawback of a world economy where the payoff goes to ideas is higher inequality among the idea generators together with a greater role for both opportunity and luck—but — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1018">1018</a> ^ref-14029</p>

<p>The epistemological consequence is that with Mediocristan-style randomness it is not possible* to have a Black Swan surprise such that a single event can dominate a phenomenon. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1073">1073</a> ^ref-8673</p>

<p>Mistaking a naïve observation of the past as something definitive or representative of the future is the one and only cause of our inability to understand the Black Swan. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1212">1212</a> ^ref-59487</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the turkey, the nonfeeding of the one thousand and first day is a Black Swan. For the butcher, it is not, since its occurrence is not unexpected. So you can see here that the Black Swan is a sucker’s problem. In other words, it occurs relative to your expectation. You realize that you can eliminate a Black Swan by science (if you’re able), or by keeping an open mind. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1244">1244</a> ^ref-34682</p>

<p>like the LTCM people, you can create Black Swans with science, by giving people confidence that the Black Swan cannot happen—this is when science turns normal citizens into suckers. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1247">1247</a> ^ref-958</p>

<p>In general, positive Black Swans take time to show their effect while negative ones happen very quickly—it is much easier and much faster to destroy than to build. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1255">1255</a> ^ref-4595</p>

<p>While the ancient skeptics advocated learned ignorance as the first step in honest inquiries toward truth, later medieval skeptics, both Moslems and Christians, used skepticism as a tool to avoid accepting what today we call science. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1309">1309</a> ^ref-40912</p>

<p>the sources of Black Swans today have multiplied beyond measurability.* In the primitive environment they were limited to newly encountered wild animals, new enemies, and abrupt weather changes.

<p>not theorizing is an act—that theorizing can correspond to the absence of willed activity, the “default” option.

<p>What makes nontheorizing cost you so much more energy than theorizing? First, there is the impenetrability of the activity. I said that much of it takes place outside of our awareness: if you don’t know that you are making the inference, how can you stop yourself unless you stay in a continuous state of alert? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1666">1666</a> ^ref-45224</p>

<p>It appears that pattern perception increases along with the concentration in the brain of the chemical dopamine. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1672">1672</a> ^ref-17928</p>
<hr>
<p>A higher concentration of dopamine appears to lower skepticism and result in greater vulnerability to pattern detection; an injection of L-dopa, a substance used to treat patients with Parkinson’s disease, seems to increase such activity and lowers one’s suspension of belief. The person becomes vulnerable to all manner of fads, such as astrology, superstitions, economics, and tarot-card reading. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1674">1674</a> ^ref-42437</p>

<p>warn the reader that I am not focusing on dopamine as the reason for our overinterpreting; rather, my point is that there is a physical and neural correlate to such operation and that our minds are largely victims of our physical embodiment. Our minds are like inmates, captive to our biology, unless we manage a cunning escape. It is the lack of our control of such inferences that I am stressing. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1682">1682</a> ^ref-40168</p>

<p>With so many brain cells—one hundred billion (and counting)—the attic is quite large, so the difficulties probably do not arise from storage-capacity limitations, but may be just indexing problems. Your conscious, or working, memory, the one you are using to read these lines and make sense of their meaning, is considerably smaller than the attic. Consider that your working memory has difficulty holding a mere phone number longer than seven digits. Change metaphors slightly and imagine that your consciousness is a desk in the Library of Congress: no matter how many books the library holds, and makes available for retrieval, the size of your desk sets some processing limitations. Compression is vital to the performance of conscious work. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1694">1694</a> ^ref-63860</p>

<p>Platonicity affects us here once again. The very same desire for order, interestingly, applies to scientific pursuits—it is just that, unlike art, the (stated) purpose of science is to get to the truth, not to give you a feeling of organization or make you feel better. We tend to use knowledge as therapy. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1718">1718</a> ^ref-3196</p>

<p>Narrativity can viciously affect the remembrance of past events as follows: we will tend to more easily remember those facts from our past that fit a narrative, while we tend to neglect others that do not appear to play a causal role in that narrative. Consider that we recall events in our memory all the while knowing the answer of what happened subsequently. It is literally impossible to ignore posterior information when solving a problem. This simple inability to remember not the true sequence of events but a reconstructed one will make history appear in hindsight to be far more explainable than it actually was—or is. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1734">1734</a> ^ref-948</p>

<p>agents underweigh small probabilities when they engage in sequential experiments in which they derive the probabilities themselves, when they are not supplied with the odds. If you draw from an urn with a very small number of red balls and a high number of black ones, and if you do not have a clue about the relative proportions, you are likely to underestimate the number of red balls. It is only when you are supplied with their frequency—say, by telling you that 3 percent of the balls are red—that you overestimate it in your betting decision. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1865">1865</a> ^ref-29947</p>

<p>The economist Hyman Minsky sees the cycles of risk taking in the economy as following a pattern: stability and absence of crises encourage risk taking, complacency, and lowered awareness of the possibility of problems.

<p>Note that neurobiologists make, roughly, a similar distinction to that between System 1 and System 2, except that they operate along anatomical lines. Their distinction differentiates between parts of the brain, the cortical part, which we are supposed to use for thinking, and which distinguishes us from other animals, and the fast-reacting limbic brain, which is the center of emotions, and which we share with other mammals. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=1953">1953</a> ^ref-12973</p>

<p>The stability of species. Take the number of species that we now consider extinct. For a long time scientists took the number of such species as that implied from an analysis of the extant fossils. But this number ignores the silent cemetery of species that came and left without leaving traces in the form of fossils; the fossils that we have managed to find correspond to a smaller proportion of all species that came and disappeared. This implies that our biodiversity was far greater than it seemed at first examination. A more worrisome consequence is that the rate of extinction of species may be far greater than we think—close to 99.5 percent of species that transited through earth are now extinct, a number that scientists have kept raising through time. Life is a great deal more fragile than we have allowed for. But this does not mean we (humans) should feel guilty for extinctions around us; nor does it mean that we should act to stop them—species were coming and going before we started messing up the environment. There is no need to feel moral responsibility for every endangered species. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=2405">2405</a> ^ref-56901</p>

A nerd is simply someone who thinks exceedingly inside the box. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=2691">2691</a> ^ref-10806</p>

<p>the ludic fallacy—the attributes of the uncertainty we face in real life have little connection to the sterilized ones we encounter in exams and games. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=2702">2702</a> ^ref-6851</p>

<p>I propose that if you want a simple step to a higher form of life, as distant from the animal as you can get, then you may have to denarrate, that is, shut down the television set, minimize time spent reading newspapers, ignore the blogs. Train your reasoning abilities to control your decisions; nudge System 1 (the heuristic or experiential system) out of the important ones. Train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empirical. This insulation from the toxicity of the world will have an additional benefit: it will improve your well-being. Also, bear in mind how shallow we are with probability, the mother of all abstract notions. You do not have to do much more in order to gain a deeper understanding of things around you. Above all, learn to avoid “tunneling.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=2838">2838</a> ^ref-61160</p>

<p>When I ask people to name three recently implemented technologies that most impact our world today, they usually propose the computer, the Internet, and the laser. All three were unplanned, unpredicted, and unappreciated upon their discovery, and remained unappreciated well after their initial use. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=2857">2857</a> ^ref-19863</p>

<p>Moral? The more information you give someone, the more hypotheses they will formulate along the way, and the worse off they will be.

<p>and belief perseverance, the tendency not to reverse opinions you already have. Remember that we treat ideas like possessions, and it will be hard for us to part with them. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=3022">3022</a> ^ref-52254</p>

<p>We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our successes to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good stuff, but not for the bad. This causes us to think that we are better than others at whatever we do for a living. Ninety-four percent of Swedes believe that their driving skills put them in the top 50 percent of Swedish drivers; 84 percent of Frenchmen feel that their lovemaking abilities put them in the top half of French lovers. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=3177">3177</a> ^ref-19997</p>

<p>effectively tested practitioners of something called game theory, in which the most notorious player is John Nash, the schizophrenic mathematician made famous by the film A Beautiful Mind. Sadly, for all the intellectual appeal of these methods and all the media attention, its practitioners are no better at predicting than university students. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=3223">3223</a> ^ref-49379</p>

<p>When an economist fails to predict outliers he often invokes the issue of earthquakes or revolutions, claiming that he is not into geodesics, atmospheric sciences, or political science, instead of incorporating these fields into his studies and accepting that his field does not exist in isolation. Economics is the most insular of fields; it is the one that quotes least from outside itself! — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00139XTG4&amp;location=3233">3233</a> ^ref-45736</p>
