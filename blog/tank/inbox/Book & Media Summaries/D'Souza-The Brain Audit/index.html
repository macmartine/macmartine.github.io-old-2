<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>This affirms that we’re not making up problems to scare customers into buying our products/services. All we’re really doing is highlighting the issues that exist. And showing customers how their lives can be better, if they adopt our products/services. And of course, we do this by highlighting the problem. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=449">449</a> ^ref-6978</p>
<hr>
<p>Your customer is juggling several problems all at once. If you don’t elevate the problem, your customer will never notice your product or service. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=475">475</a> ^ref-21070</p>
<hr>
<p>Elevating a problem ensures that your product or service gets higher priority than everything else. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=477">477</a> ^ref-1473</p>
<hr>
<p>Every product or service solves many problems. To get your message out effectively, you have to isolate the problem. In other words, choose ONE. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=507">507</a> ^ref-3425</p>
<hr>
<p>This isolation of the problem is necessary because people are busy. They’re busy with their problems. And unless the problem you state is crystal clear, they may be more than likely to miss your message. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=558">558</a> ^ref-46532</p>
<hr>
<p>The customer needs to be alerted to a single problem at a time. And the customer has to be taken through one ‘room at a time.’ — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=566">566</a> ^ref-28238</p>
<hr>
<p>The front door could be any of your products or services. First get them through the front door. Then move the customers systematically through the rest of your products and services. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=572">572</a> ^ref-40087</p>
<hr>
<p>The Problem gets our instant attention. This is because our brain is always on the lookout for the problem. While solutions may or may not engage the brain, a problem always gets the brain’s attention. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=582">582</a> ^ref-28886</p>
<hr>
<p>The customer is more likely to respond to specifics. And once the customer has responded, you can then show the customer the rest of your products/services. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=593">593</a> ^ref-57871</p>
<hr>
<p>Solutions do a great job, but they need to follow the problem to create impact. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=613">613</a> ^ref-36038</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the role of the solution: to bring relief. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=635">635</a> ^ref-15136</p>
<hr>
<p>In just about any market, there are going to be competitors. And you can bet your socks that most of your competitors won’t understand the concept of the problem and solution. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=656">656</a> ^ref-41844</p>
<hr>
<p>The solution does indeed have a place. And its rightful place is right after you’ve brought up the problem. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=660">660</a> ^ref-45022</p>
<hr>
<p>Audit your communication rigorously for solutions popping up first. Your natural tendency will be to put a solution first. Resist that temptation and keep it second. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=757">757</a> ^ref-38278</p>
<hr>
<p>The solution is different from the process. The client is not interested in how you do things—well, not at the start anyway. The role of the solution is to nullify the problem, not to explain the long-winded process you use. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=758">758</a> ^ref-11802</p>
<hr>
<p>The concept of ‘target audience’ is misleading, because while audiences may appear to be similar, their individual needs may vary wildly. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=784">784</a> ^ref-47839</p>
<hr>
<p>Target profile is simply the factor of choosing one person. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=795">795</a> ^ref-56606</p>
<hr>
<p>Yet, you exclude the rest of the board, aiming only for the bullseye. You do this because you know the bullseye gets you the maximum number of points. And so it is with profiling. You could try to include everyone (include any part of the dartboard, that is), and yet focusing on your bullseye is what gives you maximum impact. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=994">994</a> ^ref-58437</p>
<hr>
<p>If you want to get maximum impact you’re going to have to exclude people. Strangely, the more niche you make your product/service seem, the more you’ll find people attracted to it. Just like on a board, where the tiniest part of the board seems to attract the largest number of dart-throwers. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=996">996</a> ^ref-32584</p>
<hr>
<p>Every business has many products and services. And each product or service will have many audiences. In today’s world, it’s easy to tackle all those audiences—one at a time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1014">1014</a> ^ref-50034</p>
<hr>
<p>The board represents your company and profile. And you can have many products and services, as you’ve seen in the case studies. You just have to pick a profile for each of those products and services in order to attract the right audience. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1016">1016</a> ^ref-3902</p>
<hr>
<p>Your product or service will solve multiple problems. See that dart board. When you get really good at communicating your product/service, you get really good at throwing multiple darts on the bullseye. So heck yeah, you will get all your darts on a bullseye. And today’s technology allows you to send out several messages to different audiences. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1023">1023</a> ^ref-38196</p>
<hr>
<p>Every product will solve multiple problems. Yet if you base your marketing on individual profiles, each message will be far more powerful than if you simply try to get every single problem across in the same message. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1027">1027</a> ^ref-62049</p>
<hr>
<p>Magical as this understanding of problem, solution and ‘target profile’ may seem, the magic moves up to a whole new level when you combine the problem, solution and ‘target’ together. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1080">1080</a> ^ref-12546</p>
<hr>
<p>profile’. An audience represents a group of people who seem to have something in common. The ‘target profile’ is just one person. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1085">1085</a> ^ref-12896</p>
<hr>
<p>To create a profile, we have to take five specific steps: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1091">1091</a> ^ref-42122</p>
<hr>
<p>If the roller coaster were simply to do one big upside down turn and nothing else, the roller coaster ride would be over in a matter of seconds. And so it is with your customer. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1171">1171</a> ^ref-43354</p>
<hr>
<p>But what’s the purpose of bringing up the ‘problem’ and ‘solution’ so many times? Remember the purpose of the ‘problem’ and ‘solution’? It was meant to get your attention. But that attention—like in the case of the cop car—soon wavers. The roller coaster effect keeps that attention going, so that the customer continues to stay at full alert as you continue to deliver your message. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1181">1181</a> ^ref-33722</p>
<hr>
<p>And here’s how you can get a list of objections. By sitting down and brainstorming all the possible objections within your sales force/staff. Or you can actually ask your customers/potential customers. The more you know, the more you’re able to defuse objections and enable customers to buy products/services from you. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1384">1384</a> ^ref-50149</p>
<hr>
<p>And here’s what you need to pay close attention to: objections are the flip side of testimonials. I’ll say it again. The objections form ‘one side of the coin’, and the testimonials are the ‘other side of the coin.’ — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1433">1433</a> ^ref-17545</p>
<hr>
<p>The worst thing that can happen, is that a client brings up an objection, e.g. your price is too high, and you sit there wondering what to say.[8] — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1446">1446</a> ^ref-16403</p>
<hr>
<p>A reverse testimonial talks about doubt. It starts with the skepticism first. It describes the fear or uncertainty racing through the customer’s mind at the point of purchase. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1479">1479</a> ^ref-49183</p>
<hr>
<p>You don’t want to ‘get’ a testimonial. You want to have a plan, so you can ‘construct’ the testimonial in a systematic manner instead. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1496">1496</a> ^ref-38992</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s say you have three main objections that you need to defuse. And let’s say you call up the customer. Ask the customer if ‘expense, or distance, or comfort’ was one of their big issues. If they say yes, continue down that track, and they’ll give you the specifics of why ‘expense’ or ‘distance’ or ‘comfortable accommodation’ was an issue. But if they disagree, and come up with a completely different issue, e.g. they say, ‘I thought the bad weather was going to be a dampener’, then hey, keep following that customer’s train of thought. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1567">1567</a> ^ref-7540</p>
<hr>
<p>Each product or service has many testimonial angles. Make sure you use several angles in your testimonials. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1587">1587</a> ^ref-28721</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s the seeming lack of reality in a testimonial that makes us doubt its genuineness. So the way to pump back the reality is to give a testimonial a before/after effect. And voilà, we get the ‘reverse testimonial’. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1644">1644</a> ^ref-10823</p>
<hr>
<p>The ‘reverse testimonial’ is nothing but a testimonial that brings to the fore how the customer was feeling before they made the purchase. The doubts; the slight discomfort; the pain; the frustration. These all run through a customer’s mind right before they buy a product/service. These doubts need to be brought up front, because they bring a massive dose of reality to the testimonial. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1646">1646</a> ^ref-63558</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two stages to creating risk reversal. 1) The obvious risk 2) The hidden risk. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1714">1714</a> ^ref-50420</p>
<hr>
<p>Every project can be broken up into several sub-projects. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1821">1821</a> ^ref-18769</p>
<hr>
<p>For customers to even try the biriyani, they need to know that all the risk lies with the seller. This makes a customer far more willing to buy your product/service. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1934">1934</a> ^ref-22726</p>
<hr>
<p>Remember to name the risk reversal. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1945">1945</a> ^ref-39948</p>
<hr>
<p>You may believe that risk reversing is risky. But customers will only ask for their money back if your product/service really needs to be fixed. If you’re working on a service-only project, break up the project into tiny slices, and give a risk reversal for each slice, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1948">1948</a> ^ref-63586</p>
<hr>
<p>Most people trying to find their uniqueness ask the question: What’s unique about my business? Instead they should be asking: “What do I <em>want to do</em> in my business that’s different from everyone else?” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1989">1989</a> ^ref-33861</p>
<hr>
<p>You don’t find your uniqueness; you invent it. Choose one of the factors you want to be the best at, and then build your business around that factor of uniqueness. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=1999">1999</a> ^ref-42646</p>
<hr>
<p>The risk reversal is also intrinsically linked to their uniqueness. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=2082">2082</a> ^ref-8859</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s when you bite the bullet and stand for one thing that you really create a uniqueness factor. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=2127">2127</a> ^ref-8549</p>

<p>Weighted ranking is used for more accurate decision-making. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=2161">2161</a> ^ref-3104</p>
<hr>
<p>So if I were to give you ten votes, and tell you to allocate those votes between tea, coffee and hot chocolate, then the result may look like this: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=2169">2169</a> ^ref-19460</p>
<hr>
<p>To create your uniqueness, all you have to do is make a wish for your customers. If there is one thing you’d wish to improve in the life of your customers, what would that one thing be? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00COQFUNU&amp;location=2283">2283</a> ^ref-62959</p>
