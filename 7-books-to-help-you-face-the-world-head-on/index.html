				<p>Over the last year or so I've discovered some of most impactful books I've ever read.</p>
<p>Here are some of the standouts that I think everyone interested in the respective categories should read, from business to philosophy, from overcoming pain to quantum gravity.</p>
<h3>1. <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50021854-the-way-out' target='_blank'>The Way Out: A Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven Approach to Healing Chronic Pain</a> by Alan Gordon</h3>
<p>I'm starting with this one, because if you aren't feeling well mentally as well as physically, you can't be at your best; you are bottlenecked before you even start.</p>
<p>If you have, or have ever had chronic pain, severe or mild — I would even argue simply wonder why you don't feel better than you do — this book will open up a new world of where to look for the solution. It picks up where <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/361775.The_Mindbody_Prescription' target='_blank'>John Sarno</a> left off with his work on the mindbody connection, and the impact that our brain can have on our entire being, with focus on the physical.</p>
<p>I have first-hand experience applying what I learned here and I can safely say it helped get me through debilitating pain after many months of seeing every kind of doctor I could find.</p>
<h3>2. <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58612786-100m-offers' target='_blank'>100M Offers: How To Make Offers So Good People Feel Stupid Saying No</a> by Alex Hormozi</h3>
<p>If you haven't heard of Alex, this may look gimmicky at first glance, but think again. I glossed over this the first handful of times I saw it mentioned, and then the recommendations kept coming and I could no longer ignore them.</p>
<p>If you are selling a product, own or run a business, or are in sales or marketing, this book is a must read. It proposes an invaluable process to creating differentiation through the offer alone. Simply reading this book on it's own won't change your life, but if you apply what you learn, it's guaranteed to take your business to a while other level.</p>
<p>I'm in the process of applying this framework now in my software business, and will report on the progress in future posts.</p>
<h3>3. <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29513878-inner-engineering' target='_blank'>Inner Engineering: A Yogi's Guide to Joy</a> by Sadhguru</h3>
<p>Sadhguru has become really popular in the spirituality space, and for good reason.</p>
<p>This book is simple, yet eye-opening. It provides a lot of great reminders and ways of looking at life.</p>
<p>My biggest takeaways came from his approach to negotiating with yourself in the conflict of desires and progress, versus appreciating what you have and being content in this moment.</p>
<h3>4. <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41721428-can-t-hurt-me' target='_blank'>Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds</a> by David Goggins</h3>
<p>Moving, inspiring, and motivating, this book will make you want to go take on feats you never thought you'd consider.</p>
<p>David tells his story of growing up in an environment that for most would be really difficult, if not impossible, to rise above.</p>
<p>Overcoming a very traumatic childhood, David went on to becoming a top Navy SEAL, the &quot;toughest man alive&quot;, Guinness record holder for most number of pull-ups done in 24 hours, and conquered the world's most brutal ultra-endurance events.</p>
<p>Read this, and you'll have a hard time letting yourself make excuses for just about anything.</p>
<h3>5. <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19661852-fluent-forever' target='_blank'>Fluent Forever: How to Learn Any Language Fast and Never Forget It</a> by Gabriel Wyner</h3>
<p>If you're interested in learning a new language, Fluent Forever is a must-read.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I have more to do here myself - I started to apply these techniques before we moved to Croatia, and once here realized enough people speak English, that sadly, my progress here waned.</p>
<p>Still, I'm convinced the methods in this book work, as I saw quick progress once starting to apply them. Honestly, even if you don't, it's a fascinating window into a way of learning from an experienced linguist.</p>
<h3>6. <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54898389-the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant' target='_blank'>The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness</a> by Eric Jorgenson</h3>
<p>There aren't many people I've been admiring more over the last few years than Naval Ravikant.</p>
<p>The views he shares fall perfectly at the intersection business, entrepreneurship, philosophy, and living a simple, meaningful life with close friends and family.</p>
<p>It's always refreshing coming across someone who can be very successful in business, yet the more successful they become, the closer they seem to get to what's truly important in life, as opposed to money or fame.</p>
<h3>7. <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29767627-reality-is-not-what-it-seems' target='blank'>Reality is Not What it Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity</a> by Carlo Rovelli</h3>
<p>Carlo Rovelli is an Italian theoretical physicist, and the author of a number of the most well-respected books on the subject.</p>
<p>There are few things I love more than a book that &quot;breaks my brain&quot;, as I like to call it. That is, gets me thinking about the unfathomable way the world works, knowing that there is always an answer out there, even if every conceivable option is impossible to wrap my head around.</p>
<p>This book is so jam-packed with mind-blowing insights and observations about the world we live in that you will want to give it your full attention. In this way, I wouldn't call it light reading for the non-physicist, that said, it's accessible to most that possess an interest in the subject.</p>
