If you don't know where you want to go, any road will get you there."

It's easy to say what you don't want. It's more important to know what you do want. What's the most important thing?

Get clear on your values and objectives. Don't be the bottleneck.


List your objectives.
Compare them, and see which one's matter more, as some may conflict.
Introduce quantities to objectives. Maybe you don't want to manage a real estate investment, but what is the threshold? 1 hour per week?
Make your objectives battle for priority.
