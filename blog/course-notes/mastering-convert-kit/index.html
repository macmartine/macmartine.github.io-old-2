<h2>Differences between automation rules and visual automations</h2>
<h3>Automation triggers:</h3>
<p>If added to sequences, they stay in that sequence. So if new emails are added well after someone went through that sequence, they'll still get it.</p>
<p>This is not the case with visual automations - the person is no longer in that sequence after they complete it</p>
<p>Setting custom field data when in automation rule, cannot use liquid</p>
<h3>Starting visual automation from another visual automation</h3>
<p>When you do this, the first visual automation does not wait for the other to complete. So if you want it to wait, you need to set a tag in the other one, once it's done. Then in the first one set it just continue when that tag is set</p>
<h3>Delays</h3>
<p>Automation rules are immediate</p>
<p>So even if a sequence is set to go out at a certain time, the first will go out immediately when that sequence is triggered.</p>
<p>With visual automations the delay is always relative to the previous thing. Effectively the same thing as delaying for 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Segmentation</h2>
<p>Questions asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>What stage are you in? (WHO)</li>
<li>What stage are you in now? (NOW)</li>
<li>Explain deficiencies (WHY)</li>
<li>Describe your ideal business/outcome (TOMORROW)</li>
</ul>
<p>Segmentation goals:</p>
<p>Stage</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking for idea</li>
<li>Have idea, haven't started</li>
<li>Development</li>
<li>&lt; $10k revenue</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>$10k revenue</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Onlooker</li>
</ul>
<p>Why they feel they are being held back</p>
<ul>
<li>Can't find idea</li>
<li>No time, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>Find out their #1, not multiple answers</p>
<p>Where did Brennan get the 224 initial segmentation results? Ask because of course we want it to be similar traffic to what we'll be getting in the end.</p>
