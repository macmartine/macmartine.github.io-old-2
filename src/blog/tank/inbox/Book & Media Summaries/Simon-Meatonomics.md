## Highlights
Take hog farmers, who routinely spend an average of eight dollars more raising each pig than the animal yields when sold. — location: [123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=123) ^ref-43370

---
producers, who work hard to keep prices artificially low, are heavily responsible for driving demand. — location: [146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=146) ^ref-24514

---
because undercover investigations at factory farms invariably yield graphic images of unsafe and inhumane conditions, the industry has sought—with surprising success in a number of states—to stop the flow of these shocking images by criminalizing the exposés. — location: [163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=163) ^ref-44183

---
The thirteen-member committee that formulated the agency's latest set of nutrition recommendations was tasked with looking out for the nation's health. But the group included nine members with ties to the food industry, casting doubt on the committee's good faith and on the reliability of its output. — location: [168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=168) ^ref-5152

animal food production now surpasses both the transportation industry and electricity generation as the greatest source of greenhouse gases. — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=180) ^ref-59099

---
compared to plant protein, raising animal protein takes up to one hundred times more water, eleven times more fossil fuels, and five times more land. — location: [191](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=191) ^ref-7406

Americans consume more meat per person than anywhere else on the planet. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=203) ^ref-26854

---
it's one of the main reasons we have twice the obesity rate, twice the diabetes rate, and nearly three times the cancer rate as the rest of the world. — location: [205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=205) ^ref-44766

---
our heavy consumption of foods high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and other substances linked primarily or uniquely to animal foods has helped make us one of the sickest developed nations on Earth. — location: [207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=207) ^ref-14792

---
For every dollar in retail sales of meat, fish, eggs, or dairy, the animal food industry imposes $1.70 of external costs on society. — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=214) ^ref-46330

Over five decades, tobacco companies were shown to have caused—and ultimately were forced to pay—$400 billion in health care costs. By comparison, as we'll see, the US animal food industry generates more than $600 billion in health care costs every two years and pays virtually none of them.19 Further, unlike animal agriculture, the tobacco industry causes little ecological harm, and it's taxed—not subsidized. — location: [221](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=221) ^ref-60425

99 percent of the farm animals raised in the United States live in steel and concrete factories with no resemblance to a traditional farm. — location: [240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=240) ^ref-23674

---
Fifty years ago, only one in eight Americans was obese.25 The national obesity figure increased by an average of about one-half percentage point per year for the past five decades, moving almost in lockstep with the rise of factory farming and the decline of animal foods' retail prices. — location: [252](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=252) ^ref-25509

For almost as long as they've been in use, factory farms have been synonymous with three kinds of problems: environmental, nutritional, and ethical. This book proposes a fourth category: economic. — location: [268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=268) ^ref-18584

Psychology professor Melanie Joy has proposed the term carnism for the belief system that drives meat consumption. This entrenched system, Joy says, “is supported by every single institution in society, from medicine to education.”28 However, while this belief system is likely responsible for persuading Americans to consume animal foods in the first place, it is in large measure the price of these goods that determines how much meat and dairy people buy. — location: [273](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=273) ^ref-59871

---
while American consumption of animal foods is often perceived as demand driven—or spurred by consumer preferences and disposable income—it is actually heavily supply driven, or propelled by producer behavior. — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=278) ^ref-17423

---
changes in production methods, such as the shift from traditional farming methods to low-cost industrial practices—and the resulting declines in retail prices—deserve most of the credit for the increase in consumption. — location: [281](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=281) ^ref-52875

---
because of this government failure, the microeconomic system that produces meat and dairy is characterized by heavy overconsumption, huge inefficiencies, and massive hidden costs. — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=297) ^ref-31621

---
these programs provide funding of $557 million yearly for animal food producers to promote their goods.7 This massive, government-mandated marketing budget gives the meatonomic system something few other microeconomic systems have: an exceedingly deep marketing war chest, deployed to boost sales of all goods from all producers in the program. A few other commodities, like cotton and soybeans, have checkoff programs of their own. Yet in every other industry, except for those lucky enough to have a checkoff program, individual corporations must fork out their own funds to increase sales rather than rely on government programs to prop up their numbers. — location: [358](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B082FPPZVD&location=358) ^ref-18630
