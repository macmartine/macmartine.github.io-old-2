<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>I noticed that high-growth companies tend to go after existing problems, and they solve them with a unique twist. This means they don’t have to convince people of the fundamental problem—people are paying for a solution already. They just have to stand out with one major differentiating factor, and ideally it will be one people will talk about because they care about it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=217">217</a> ^ref-7132</p>

<p>The best part is that content is a huge brand builder. If you can focus on your design and keep your content at the same level, pushing a similar message, design, and content can work together explosively. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=248">248</a> ^ref-36286</p>

<p>Learn how to say “no”. Instead, reach “world class” status at one thing. Be confident that you can use your content marketing skills to get so much attention for this one thing that there will be plenty of demand. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=270">270</a> ^ref-28256</p>
<hr>
<p>Don’t think so much about how much money you will make in a year. Think about how much you will grow every single month, and before you know it your business will be significantly bigger. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=278">278</a> ^ref-29533</p>
<hr>
<p>This is also a great way to think about the metrics for your content. I noticed our blog traffic grew by about 5% per month in the early days. At first it didn’t seem like much, but with consistent monthly growth, before we knew it, we had tens of thousands of monthly visitors. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=280">280</a> ^ref-5233</p>
<hr>
<p>There needs to be a logical link between your content, your audience, and whatever it is you are selling. A decent percentage of your audience should be potential customers or potentially refer other customers to your service. If they aren’t, then the monetization logic is off. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=312">312</a> ^ref-49006</p>
<hr>
<p>Hopefully you spotted it: they give up too soon. It takes a long time to build momentum, and most people don't have the patience to back something that isn't delivering immediate results. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=324">324</a> ^ref-49847</p>

<p>We began to notice that the highly tactical, actionable, detailed, step-by-step content resonated well. Actionable content then became another main theme. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=399">399</a> ^ref-20419</p>

<p>You may not have a clear idea about this at first, but keep coming back to the vision as you go through this book and, over time as you create more content, something will emerge that will give you a unique edge and take your content to the next level. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=414">414</a> ^ref-45885</p>

<p>Your job first and foremost is about marketing a business with content. That’s why I prefer the term “content marketer,” and the focus for content marketers is, therefore, the business. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=457">457</a> ^ref-45435</p>

<hr>
<p>Don’t be picky about whether each piece of content is generating leads. Just create as much value as you can for the most amount of people in your chosen community. Give away as many useful things as you can, create content that people can really relate to, and if possible, offer a unique perspective that people haven’t come across before. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=506">506</a> ^ref-33056</p>
<hr>
<p>Who is your community? How are you going to help them? Spend a good amount of time thinking about this and have it documented in your content strategy. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=509">509</a> ^ref-39853</p>

<p>The 70/30 rule says that when you still don’t have a big enough audience for your posts to gain traction on their own, focus 70% of your efforts on off-site content. This could include guest posting, content partnerships, interviews on other podcasts, or more actively promoting your content. The remaining 30% should be spent on on-site content. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=516">516</a> ^ref-60067</p>

<p>Ask them what their problems are and what they need help with. Ask them what other sites they like and pay attention to what they share. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=581">581</a> ^ref-36265</p>

<p>Offering a contrarian view got me a lot of attention. At the time of release the only startup book outranking it on Amazon was Zero To One, a book about how to build a business by being contrarian. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=604">604</a> ^ref-47287</p>

<p>If you can create content that is legitimately actionable, it will get consumed more, shared more, and it will convert more readers to active community members or eventually customers. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=620">620</a> ^ref-55708</p>

<p>The way I think about it is, if 100 people just click “Like” on my content, that’s 100 people who thought it wasn’t good enough to share. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=836">836</a> ^ref-30378</p>

<p>Rather than focusing on visits or likes, I suggest looking at social media shares. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=861">861</a> ^ref-54867</p>
<hr>
<p>To work out total shares you can add buttons to your site or use Like Explorer or BuzzSumo. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=864">864</a> ^ref-33273</p>

<p>Much like shares, getting people to comment is another level above getting them to read or like a post. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=867">867</a> ^ref-44706</p>

<p>For a lot of my content, I don’t target a specific keyword. I’d rather focus on the fundamentals, and if I have a good handle on my audience, then I can probably make a good decision on the sorts of keywords to target. Sometimes, however, it makes sense to target a specific keyword, and it’s not hard to quickly check Google to see what keywords are best to look at. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=900">900</a> ^ref-34519</p>

<p>There’s no shortage of what you can do here, and the only downside is that you will help others in the industry. It might cost you some time or money, but it’s not time or money wasted as it is with advertising. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=1134">1134</a> ^ref-16904</p>

<p>Pat Flynn believed that he would capture more value for his business if he released his revenue figures rather than worry about the value lost by giving up his secrets. This belief is essentially the message in this book: “Take the content marketing leap of faith.” Yes, you do lose something when you “give away the farm”, as Neil Patel calls it. But you stand to gain much more if you can make it work. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=1248">1248</a> ^ref-35506</p>

<p>Use the “Keyword Filters” on the left to only show keywords with a certain amount of searches.

<p>Another way to build on something that’s working is through borrowing ideas from competitors. Generally, I don’t choose a direct competitor but rather someone in a related industry. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B013M5FWX4&amp;location=1310">1310</a> ^ref-7481</p>

<p>The first question here is: can you report on the news in your industry in a way that other people aren’t doing? Perhaps the typical news is bland, boring, or nonexistent.
