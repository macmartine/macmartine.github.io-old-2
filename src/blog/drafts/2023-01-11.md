## {{ title }}

I've been writing more lately, and enjoying it. As a way to think through whatever's on my mind, or to simply write it out to further embed an idea or goal in my subconscious.

I'm getting used to putting my thoughts out there, although mostly it hasn't been anything too personal or vulnerable. It's gotten me thinking about starting a newsletter as one of my small bets. While newsletters (and communities) do seem like the current hot thing, it's hard to see a downside to it.

I'm going to start thinking about a name, and a format. Initially thought is that each newsletter would include a section on:
- Building and marketing products
- A insight into human behavior, decision making, and the like
- Highlighting a valuable Tweet

I also discovered that [@LBacaj](https://twitter.com/LBacaj) and [@chr_iswong](https://twitter.com/chr_iswong) have a course called 'The Newsletter Launchpad' that looks great and is available for free in the Small Bets Community, so I am starting that.

And while I'm monetizing it isn't my main aim, I am curious to see how people are monetizing their newsletters.

Obviously there's selling ad space, and simply being able to promote your own products. What else?
