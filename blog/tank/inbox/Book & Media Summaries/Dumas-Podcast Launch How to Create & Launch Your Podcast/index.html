<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>When you work hard and create a show that has a large and engaged audience, you too will have access to the experts in your industry who simply don’t have the time to share their expertise and knowledge with people on a one-to-one basis. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=119">119</a> ^ref-1557</p>

<p>For Mac: ECamm Call recorder: Automatically record and save call audio and video on your Mac. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=247">247</a> ^ref-25414</p>

<p>In your initial episodes, it is very important to let your audience know your production schedule. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=280">280</a> ^ref-50686</p>

<p>time. When I first launched, I asked my audience for an iTunes rating and review if they enjoyed the episode. Then, I asked for listeners to come to EntrepreneurOnFire.com and join my email list. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=283">283</a> ^ref-19186</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, I have a rotating schedule of seven intros and outros where I remind listeners of different products or services I have created and where they can find them. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=285">285</a> ^ref-49807</p>
<hr>
<p>**EntrepreneurOnFire is one of nine affiliates of Libsyn. If you would like to receive the remainder of the first month and the following month for free, simply enter the code “FIRE” while setting up your account. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=333">333</a> ^ref-54191</p>
<hr>
<p>The absolute BEST real estate in the entire Podcast universe is the New and Noteworthy section in the iTunes Podcast Store. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=366">366</a> ^ref-44303</p>
<hr>
<p>Once you launch and people start to enjoy the content of your show, they are going to want a headquarters where they can learn more. You need a system that allows your listeners to share their wants, needs, desires, and most importantly, their email addresses. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=385">385</a> ^ref-35262</p>
<hr>
<p>If you go to EntrepreneurOnFire.com, then you will find a fully functioning site where I post and stream every episode, including a show notes page that sums up each show. This drives traffic back to my website, where I can then offer my listeners a lot of great value. I also have a resources page, which includes affiliate links, coaching sessions, and other valuable resources that, in addition to helping listeners, helps EntrepreneurOnFire earn money. I will delve more into this in a future chapter. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=390">390</a> ^ref-31333</p>
<hr>
<p>Your listeners all have their favorite Social Media sites, and you have to make sure they have a platform to share your show on each and every one of them. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=410">410</a> ^ref-43397</p>
<hr>
<p>Before you launch, have at least three shows completed, and publish all three at the SAME time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=418">418</a> ^ref-22900</p>
<hr>
<p>This is where your platform comes in, and YOU are your best advocate. Reach out to everyone: family, friends, people on Facebook, Twitter, past interviewees, upcoming interviewees, anyone with an iTunes account – simply ask them to take a minute to subscribe and give your show a 5-star rating and review. I have created a quick video (#12) that you are free to share. It will take your listeners through step-by-step process of how to submit a rating and review on iTunes. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=442">442</a> ^ref-13644</p>
<hr>
<p>Continue to focus, continue to produce incredible content, and continue to ask people to subscribe, rate, and review your show. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=447">447</a> ^ref-62719</p>
<hr>
<p>I also let every interviewee I have on the show know that a rating and review from them would hold a lot of weight. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=450">450</a> ^ref-64942</p>
<hr>
<p>Every morning, my first activity was to reach out to that day’s interviewee and let them know their interview was live, and that I would be honored if they would share this with their audience. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=465">465</a> ^ref-55738</p>
<hr>
<p>I made sure I had scheduled posts lined up for Facebook, Twitter, G+, and LinkedIn that would go out periodically throughout the day to catch people who would be interested in listening to that day’s interview. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=467">467</a> ^ref-4285</p>

<p>‘If you want to make millions, inspire millions.’ — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=494">494</a> ^ref-24947</p>

<p>In September of 2013, EntrepreneurOnFire began publishing our income reports to share all of our earnings, expenses, successes and failures. I recommend studying these to see which strategies appeal to you, and then go ahead and try to implement some in your own business! — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=496">496</a> ^ref-23556</p>
<hr>
<p>My Resources Page is one of the top three highest trafficked pages on my site and is a compilation of all the resources I recommend to Fire Nation as they start their own journey. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=503">503</a> ^ref-441</p>
<hr>
<p>I have used every one of the resources I recommend, and I have affiliate relationships with each vendor. When a visitor clicks on a link from my Resources Page, a unique URL alerts the vendor that they came from my page. If a purchase is made, I receive a commission. In the 15 months following the launch of EntrepreneurOnFire, my Resources Page was responsible for over $50,000 in affiliates sales. This is not necessarily ‘retire early’ money, but nothing to shy away from, either. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=505">505</a> ^ref-12876</p>
<hr>
<p>On that note, there are several techniques you can use to drive even more affiliate traffic through your affiliate links, like what I did with my BlueHost link specifically: I created a 7-minute video tutorial just for anyone who uses my affiliate link, and I promote this in one of my intros on EntrepreneurOnFire. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=509">509</a> ^ref-16385</p>
<hr>
<p>I recommend The One Thing by Gary Keller. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=519">519</a> ^ref-50153</p>

<p>When Entrepreneurs are ready to take their own leap, they often look for coaches/mentors to guide them through the unknown terrain they are about to face. When you host a show, you gain instant credibility and authority in that niche, and you have the opportunity to develop an intimate connection with your audience by providing them with the content they’re looking for. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=524">524</a> ^ref-18182</p>
<hr>
<p>I reached out to a mentor in my field, Jaime Tardy of The Eventual Millionaire. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=530">530</a> ^ref-63382</p>

<p>With the mentality that I want to impact Entrepreneurs on a personal level, I launched an Elite Mastermind Tribe called FireNationElite. We are currently a closed mastermind as we decided to cap our Tribe at 100 members. However, you can always find out more and join the wait list here: FireNationElite.com. FireNationElite is a great example of how I’ve created a Mastermind that generates recurring revenue, as each member pays quarterly to be a part of the Mastermind. EntrepreneurOnFire generates $13,500 every month from this venture, and this would not be possible if it weren’t for the credibility I’ve gained in my niche via the Podcast. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00BJUIT1W&amp;location=537">537</a> ^ref-24577</p>
