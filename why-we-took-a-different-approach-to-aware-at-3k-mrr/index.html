				<h2>Why we took a different approach to Aware at $3k MRR</h2>
<p>It's crazy to say, but we've been working on Aware for nearly 3 years now. For the first while, it was definitely not on the front burner, as selling my last business took a lot of time, then we were getting ready to move abroad, then I basically took the summer off while we traveled Europe.</p>
<p>When looking at the MRR, it definitely doesn't look like high, or fast growth. However, knowing the time and effort we put in to get to $3k MRR, we did it relatively easily. I'm not saying planning and building, conversations and demos didn't take time. But rather when it came time to start getting our first customers, we didn't have that scary feeling of approaching a huge wall that we have no idea how to get over. Most of our first customers came from existing connections, or clients and potential clients of Alex's services agency.</p>
<p>So if we got there with relative ease, why did we decide over rethink our entire approach to the problem we solve?</p>
<p>In short, we made too many assumptions, were too opinionated, and asked too much of our users.</p>
<p>Let's break it down:</p>
<p>Our first issue was that our onboarding process, which we initially thought to be super powerful and robust, turned out to overwhelm the average user. We made assumptions that people doing social selling would intimately know their target market, including demographics, company attributes, and the titles of the decision makers they were after. It turns out that many don't, so this would require a lot of hand-holding and manual onboarding on our part.</p>
<p>What we were doing was working in a sense, but it wasn't scalable, and we were losing customers that we knew we could provide value to, but that were just getting hung up during onboarding.</p>
<p>Our other main problem occurred once a user was onboarded. While to the seasoned social seller, or Aware user, we were putting value in front of your face in the form of engaged leads matching your ICP criteria, we were doing so in an unclear way. We were providing direct links to where your ICPs are engaging, and who they're engaging with. But it wasn't obvious what they should do. We were simply pointing out conversations our user should be engaging in, but they had to leave our application to do so, and we therefore couldn't provide much guidance. We were expecting our users to know what to do, and making them think too much.</p>
<p>In creating a valuable tool our job is to provide real value by making people's lives easier. This can be done any number of way such as by saving them time, making them have to think less, or giving them insights they didn't previously have.</p>
<p>Even if a product does succeed in one of more of these areas, it may be taking taking causing more friction in other areas. For us, we believe we were providing value in the form of saving the user time AND finding insights (leads) they didn't otherwise know about. But we were also<br>
making them have to know more about their target market than they already did, follow our prescribed, opinionated social selling playbook, and know what to do with the leads and conversations that we surfaced. There were too many prerequisites and too many expectations.</p>
<p>As we considered our options, here's what we came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rethink our approach to be less opinionated. Find a way to make the application work well for more basic users, and include the more advanced features as options for as they progress on their journey to become a more advanced user and social seller. We could provide value to people in earlier stages, and support them along their journey as they learn and grow.</li>
<li>Update our messaging to be more specific about who we could help, and blatantly exclude people that aren't a right fit.</li>
<li>Provide more education to users about how to better define their target market. While we feel strongly that this is something every business should do, it creates a lot of friction in getting someone to be an engaged user.</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to do all of these things, with the first two as top priorities. The specific actions we have taken, are that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebuilt the interface almost from the ground-up to be overall more user-friendly.</li>
<li>Removed the complicated onboarding process, and we are gradually adding those features as optional, advanced features.</li>
<li>Dramatically improved the method for accepting a users' LinkedIn credentials.</li>
<li>Added an analytics page where we can provide value the moment a user gives us access to their LinkedIn account. Insights anyone can understand.</li>
<li>Added the ability to interact and engage on LinkedIn without leaving our application. We didn't do this initially because it adds some complexity to the application code which we wrongly assumed wasn't yet worth it. But adding this small amount of complexity creates a huge leap forward in helping our users know exactly what their next actionable steps are. And it keeps their eyeballs in our application, instead of bouncing them back and forth to LinkedIn. It's a more seamless experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like to think this is a good example of riding that line between believing in your idea, while not being married to it. We need to be able to objectively take what our users our saying, and interpret their behavior, and adjust accordingly. Unfortunately most users aren't aware of where the friction is, nor can they articulate how we might be able to improve the experience and solve the problem better. So we need to be able to figure this out for ourselved from the data we have,<br>
and be open to change, without losing confidence or focus.</p>
