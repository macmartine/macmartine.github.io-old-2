# Now

## February 2023

I've been migrating digital tools again. Every time I switch away from the most minimal tools, I regret it. I prefer [VIM](https://www.vim.org) and text/markdown files every time. I was trying [Notion](https://notion.so), then [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and they were fine, but I don't like having to use a mouse more than I need to and I'm much more comfortable in VIM. Any time I forget this, I should just go back to [Derek Sivers' site](https://sive.rs/) for an inspirational reminder.

In addition I've been thinking a lot about the format and delivery of the content I'm producing. I've discovered [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), and [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/), and loving this concept of evergreen, deeply-linked content, forming a web of associations, over the linear streams of information we've become used to on the web.

I read [Tiago Forte's](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/), and while I enjoy the overall concept, going back in time to the [Zettlekasten](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) has been more productive for me. I love the way it ties in to a digital garden.

I've started a digital garden and considering how I'll incorporate it into [macmartine.com](https://www.macmartine.com), and [The Curious Innovator](/newsletter) newsletter. The newsletter may simply become my best/favorite Zettlekasten's from the previous week.
