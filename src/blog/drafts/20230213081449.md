Would you rather be proud of what you're working on today in the future, or cringe?

It's possible to do both, and that's what you should strive for.

If you look back on your work from 10 years ago and don't cringe a little, it's a sign you haven't grown in your craft. 

But if you do cringe a little, you can still be proud of that work, knowing that you did the best you could at the time, and it was a success. And you can be proud that you've grown since.
