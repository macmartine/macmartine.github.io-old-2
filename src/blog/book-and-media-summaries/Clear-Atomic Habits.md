## Highlights
Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. — location: [359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=359) ^ref-55793

A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision. — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=383) ^ref-64737

Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” — location: [895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=895) ^ref-50122

Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations. — location: [1172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1172) ^ref-15806

---
So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. — location: [1175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1175) ^ref-32567

One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. — location: [1444](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1444) ^ref-45588

If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in. — location: [1695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1695) ^ref-15900

In 1860, the English philosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak a new language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channels through which each sensation has to pass have not become established; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a pathway, than this difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they can be performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.” Both common sense and scientific evidence agree: repetition is a form of change. — location: [1710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1710) ^ref-16738

---
This means that simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit. — location: [1715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1715) ^ref-45344

Text messaging reduces the friction of sending a letter in the mail. — location: [1820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1820) ^ref-12650
