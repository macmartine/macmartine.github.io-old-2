<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>As a wholesaler, your job is to connect sellers’ fear and the greed of the hungry investors who want a good rate of return on their money. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=255">255</a> ^ref-20717</p>
<hr>
<p>When there are more buyers than sellers (that is, when the supply of homes is short), we are in a seller’s market. That’s usually when the inventory of homes falls under six months’ worth of supply. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=262">262</a> ^ref-31843</p>
<hr>
<p>The only problem for wholesalers in a buyer’s market is that there are so many good deals to be made directly with the bank via short sales, REOs, and auctions that a savvy investor may not even look to a wholesaler for deals. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=276">276</a> ^ref-46099</p>
<hr>
<p>As a wholesaler, your job is to connect hungry investors who have tons of cash to motivated sellers who need to sell. You are a broker connecting fear to greed. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=312">312</a> ^ref-28550</p>
<hr>
<p>When there are more buyers than sellers (the supply of homes is short), we’re in a seller’s market and prices go up, creating instant equity. Many end cash buyers come to wholesalers to find deals. • When there are more sellers than buyers (the supply of homes is flooding the streets), we’re in a buyer’s market and prices go down. Many motivated sellers will come to wholesalers to dump their homes. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=316">316</a> ^ref-45190</p>

<p>A successful wholesaler has no thought limitations and sees the world as an enormous ocean of money. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=320">320</a> ^ref-11869</p>
<hr>
<p>You’d only use a hard-money loan if you had no end buyer ready and waiting to purchase the property from you and had to close the transaction yourself. If you had a buyer lined up, you’d use transactional funding. This should be your primary goal. In transactional funding, the money comes from the same hard-money investor, but it’s considerably cheaper because of the time frame—the whole transaction is concluded within twenty-four hours. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=350">350</a> ^ref-30877</p>

<p>mail. This same very basic ad can also be put on Craigslist, Postlets, Facebook, LinkedIn, real estate groups, thrift magazines/penny savers, or any other website where you can sell things. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=484">484</a> ^ref-57116</p>
<hr>
<p>Another very cool thing you can do is identify the big players in your market by checking the MLS or multiple listing service, a real estate database that tracks all real estate for sale or already sold in your area. You’ll need to befriend a real estate agent who can help you, or get your own real estate license. I strongly recommend you get a license if don’t have one already. You will be way ahead of the curve if you do, and you can earn the 3 to 6 percent real estate commission on top of your wholesale commission. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=494">494</a> ^ref-409</p>
<hr>
<p>ask if your real estate agent friend will check the transactions that closed by “transaction type: cash” during the past twelve months in the particular area, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=499">499</a> ^ref-65030</p>
<hr>
<p>Your buyers list will naturally develop a concentration of buyers in a certain area. If you have many buyers from a specific area, target that area for your “big player” buyers. This is the same area you will want to try to acquire deals or property in. More on this later. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=500">500</a> ^ref-47897</p>
<hr>
<p>The real estate agent who stands to double-dip is much more motivated to get the seller to accept the contract, even when you’re up front about looking to flip the contract. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=578">578</a> ^ref-12086</p>
<hr>
<p>Typically, with multiunits, investors look at the cap rate (capitalization rate), which is simply the rate of return on the property at any given point in time. The formula is simple: net operating income of the property divided by the purchase price: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=597">597</a> ^ref-31910</p>
<hr>
<p>Add the criteria “No short sales” and “No REOs” to the MLS. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=633">633</a> ^ref-55486</p>
<hr>
<p>The best property to wholesale is one that needs minimal work, rather than taking on a complete overhaul or full gut job to start with. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=662">662</a> ^ref-62918</p>
<hr>
<p>Target properties that need less than $20,000 in repairs. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=665">665</a> ^ref-56531</p>
<hr>
<p>Real estate agents also have access to expired listings. This sounds like something that’s over and done with, but that’s not the case. These are, in essence, properties that have been on the market for very long, sometimes six months or more, and haven’t sold. Sometimes the list price was too high, or the real estate agent was lazy and didn’t market the property correctly. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=703">703</a> ^ref-61986</p>
<hr>
<p>Remember: we are targeting distressed and motivated sellers. The more desperate an individual is to sell, the better the spread or commission on the deal will be for you. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=719">719</a> ^ref-15220</p>
<hr>
<p>Targeting people who are delinquent on their property taxes might work well for you. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=722">722</a> ^ref-21709</p>

<p>situation. Your local county tax authority usually publishes delinquencies in a general-circulation paper or other local press pertaining to a specific county or city. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=725">725</a> ^ref-50558</p>

<p>There are many lead-generating or marketing companies that track public records and court filings of probate, divorce, or foreclosure filings, and you can purchase leads from them. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=731">731</a> ^ref-54193</p>

<p>Key lists to target should be free-and-clear landlords (with no debt on their properties), out-of-state landlords, probate properties, delinquent tax owners, and expired MLS listings. With the exception of the latter, you can obtain the lists through a list-sales company or for free by visiting the clerk of courts office in your local county. If it’s a public record, they have to make it available. Of course, a real estate agent can e-mail you results of an MLS search quickly. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=771">771</a> ^ref-5139</p>

<p>Another great hidden secret for finding great deals is properties for sale by owner (FSBO). — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=801">801</a> ^ref-23389</p>
<hr>
<p>So where do FSBOs advertise? They park themselves in your local paper, Craigslist, and the front lawn. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=803">803</a> ^ref-22675</p>

<p>Try to target properties with as many good comps as possible. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=894">894</a> ^ref-25055</p>

<p>Getting the right comps is critical and can make or break your deal. The exact criteria you need to use are these: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=895">895</a> ^ref-3132</p>

<p>On the square footage, you need it to look for plus or minus 15 percent. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=899">899</a> ^ref-51620</p>
<hr>
<p>If there is one thing I’ve learned, it’s that credibility is huge in this business. If you provide good deals and market them correctly, you will have buyers return again and again. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=926">926</a> ^ref-20827</p>
<hr>
<p>You can make much larger spreads on deals that are not on the MLS and that need a lot of repairs. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=955">955</a> ^ref-23454</p>

<p>Light rehabs, or properties that have a minimal amount of work needed ($5,000 to $10,000) are your sweet spot and what you should target. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=1035">1035</a> ^ref-27179</p>
<hr>
<p>However, once you gain confidence and your buyers list grows, try to get these full-rehab properties (properties that need substantial work and money) under contract. You can make tons of money. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0793QNZ67&amp;location=1036">1036</a> ^ref-16859</p>
