Welcome! I'm Mac. I'm an entrepreneur, family slomad, multipotentialite, and slow thinker.

I call this place you've found yourself in my digital garden, or commonplace book.

It's the place where I explore ideas, and share what I learn, as I'm learning it, with a focus on the timeless. It's my attempt to shine a light in the direction of balance and harmony in the interplay between time and money, contentment and achievement, fulfillment and desire, [present and future](src/blog/posts/2023-02-03.md).

All those little things that humans thrive on and struggle with daily - how we should live, how to get the most of out life, and how to maintain that child-like awe of this universe we find ourselves in.

Come back often, the door is always open. And please reach out and introduce yourself, I love meeting new interesting people:
