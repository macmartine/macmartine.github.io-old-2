## Highlights
Feelings and desires that have not been examined tend not to leave us alone; they linger and spread their energy randomly to neighbouring issues. — location: [55](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=55) ^ref-1492

---
Most so-called ‘addictions’ are at heart symptoms of insistent difficult feelings that we haven’t found a way to address. Insomnia is revenge for thoughts we have refused to have in the day. — location: [59](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=59) ^ref-24594

---
Philosophical Meditation, a practice with the premise that a decisive share of the trouble in our minds comes from thoughts and feelings that have not been untangled, examined and confronted with sufficient attention. — location: [74](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=74) ^ref-10771

---
three-quarters of our agitation is not that there are things to worry about, but that we haven’t given our worries the time they require to be understood and defused. — location: [87](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=87) ^ref-21050

---
Our overall nervousness declines when our anxieties are systematically laid out and examined. — location: [93](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=93) ^ref-52896

---
Entertaining the most extreme consequences can be the best way to finally neuter an otherwise nagging concern. One by one, we should confront the worst, and see that it is, for the most part, very survivable. — location: [96](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=96) ^ref-27244

Honourable self-love is not selfishness: it’s the feeling of correctly respecting ourselves. — location: [209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=209) ^ref-62890

Psychotherapists have developed a special term to capture what we inherit emotionally from the past: they call it our ‘transference’. In their view, each of us is constantly at risk of ‘transferring’ patterns of behaviour and feeling from the past to a present that doesn’t realistically call for it. We feel a need to punish people who aren’t to blame; we worry about a humiliation that isn’t on the cards; we are compelled to betray as we were once betrayed, three decades before. — location: [313](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=313) ^ref-11881

---
Maturity involves accepting with good grace that we are involved in multiple transferences, along with a commitment to try to disentangle them rationally. The job of growing up means realising with due humility the exaggerated dynamics we may constantly bring to situations and to monitor ourselves more accurately and more critically so as to improve our capacity to judge and act in the here and now with greater fairness and neutrality. The idea is to grow a little wiser as to where our troubles come from and around what areas of our lives we need to be especially careful. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=320) ^ref-7615

---
Knowing the risks of transference prioritises sympathy and understanding over irritation and judgement. We can come to see that sudden bursts of anxiety or hostility in others may not always be directly caused by us, and so should not always be met with fury or wounded pride. — location: [327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=327) ^ref-49416

Having a complex Emotional Inheritance would not be a source of shame; the pride would be that one understood its constituent parts. We don’t need people to be perfect; we simply need them to be able to explain the greater part of their inherited imperfections calmly and in good time, before we are enmeshed in the sufferings they can otherwise cause us. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=332) ^ref-26113

---
We identify something that can very effectively keep our thoughts away from troubling inner confrontations. Online pornography is a favourite, the news another, alcohol a third, work a fourth. We don’t so much like these elements in and of themselves; we like them for their ability to keep us away from what we fear. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=380) ^ref-64406

---
Denied anger with a particular person or situation often seeps out into a generalised irritability. So successful is the lie, we don’t really know what’s up: we just keep losing our tempers. Someone has moved the TV remote, there aren’t any eggs in the fridge, the electricity bill is slightly higher than expected… anything can set us off. Our brains are so filled with how frustrating and annoying things are that we have cleverly left no space for focusing on the true, very sad issue. — location: [387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=387) ^ref-61711

Afflicted by a lack of self-love, romantic relationships become almost impossible, for one of the central requirements of a capacity to accept the love of another turns out to be a confident degree of affection for ourselves, built up over the years, largely in childhood. We need a legacy of feeling that we in some basic way deserve love in order not to respond obtusely to affections granted to us by prospective adult partners. Without a decent amount of self-love, the kindness of another will always strike us as misguided or fake, even as strangely insulting, for it suggests that they haven’t even begun to understand us, so different are our relative assessments of what we happen to deserve. We end up self-destructively – although unconsciously – disappointing the intolerable, unfamiliar love that has been offered to us by someone who clearly has no clue who we are. — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=485) ^ref-42986

Most of the walnut’s flaws can be attributed to the way the instrument evolved over millions of years. It emerged to deal with threats, some of which are no longer with us; at the same time, it had no chance to develop adequate responses to a myriad of challenges generated by our own complex societies. — location: [534](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=534) ^ref-43148

---
The walnut is primed to look at things from its own point of view – or the way of looking that is long established as normal in its tribe. It often simply can’t believe that there are other ways of considering an issue. Other people can therefore seem perverse, or horrible to it – sparking outrage or self-pity. It’s only in the last second, from an evolutionary point of view, that the walnut has started to try to imagine what it might be like to be someone else (a symptom of this is that it’s learnt to take pleasure in novels). But this is still a fragile empathetic capacity, which tends to collapse, especially when the walnut is tired, and someone is trying to persuade it of a strange-sounding idea. — location: [554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=554) ^ref-46207

There are three key things that characterise the outlook of an emotionally sceptical person. They distinguish between feeling and action They don’t automatically act on their feelings. The sceptic opens up the equivalent of a demilitarised zone between emotions and actions. Having surveyed the fragilities of our minds, the Ancient Greek Sceptics recommended that we learn to develop an attitude of what they called epoche, translated as ‘reserve’ or ‘suspension of judgement’. Aware of our proclivities to error, we should never rush into decisions; we should let our ideas settle so they can be re-evaluated at different points in time. We are to be especially vigilant about the impact of sexual excitement, tiredness and public opinion on the formation of our plans. — location: [560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=560) ^ref-63914

we will go a long way to counteract the problems of our machinery if we prepare ourselves for it; if we accept that we stare out at reality through a highly unreliable and distorted pane of glass and must, therefore, frequently suspend judgement, moderate our impulses, watch over our diet, and strive to get to bed early. — location: [578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=578) ^ref-31298

---
We will finally have learnt how to know ourselves when we have a complete picture at once of what we can know – and of what we have to remain very modest about ever knowing. — location: [581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B075ZYZNJ1&location=581) ^ref-38807
