<p>When I first started out online, I was told that getting 1000 people on my email list was the minimum to have before I could launch a digital program that was profitable. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00G2QU8MG&amp;location=138">138</a> ^ref-6717</p>

<p>Another approach to setting a list building goal is to pick a “reasonable goal” and a “stretch goal”, so that the first one feels doable and attainable… but the stretch goal allows you to dream bigger. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00G2QU8MG&amp;location=146">146</a> ^ref-46952</p>

<p>Now it’s time to set up a “goal”, to track which visitors become email subscribers. Do this by clicking the “Admin” button and selecting “Goals”. 5. You’ll want to set up a “Destination Goal”, that tracks when someone visits your email subscription’s programs “thank you for joining the list” page. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00G2QU8MG&amp;location=182">182</a> ^ref-49595</p>

<p>Who they are breaks down into two categories: demographics and psychographics.  Demographics are their age, gender, vocation, location, etc. Psychographics are their values, what they have in common with you and your vision for the future. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00G2QU8MG&amp;location=194">194</a> ^ref-46444</p>

<p>Write a few words down about your ideal subscribers. What blogs do they read? What web shows do they watch? What Facebook groups do they participate in? Who do they follow on social media? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00G2QU8MG&amp;location=198">198</a> ^ref-5343</p>

<p>Write down the answers to these two questions:  1. What problems and frustrations do you solve for people?  2. What issues or questions might you be able to solve or answer before someone is ready to hire you or buy from you? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00G2QU8MG&amp;location=215">215</a> ^ref-49833</p>

<p>Some of the biggest blogs and websites on the web do well by having a “pop up” opt-in form, that appears a few seconds after someone lands on the website. The best plugin that allows you to set up these pop-ups is called PopupAlly, it’s got both a free version and a premium one that gives you more control over when and how the pop-up appears. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00G2QU8MG&amp;location=253">253</a> ^ref-19625</p>

<li>Take a look at your about page: does it have a strong call to action? This call to action can be to get in touch with you hire you, or if you want to shift to leveraged products, it should invite people to join your email list. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00G2QU8MG&amp;location=291">291</a> ^ref-37163</li>

<li>Do you have a link to your squeeze page in your navigation bar? 3. Do you have an opt-in box on every page? 4. Do you have opt-in box at the end of each of your blog posts? Check out the tutorial I created to make this happen.  5. Take a look at your site’s traffic statistics… which are your top visited pages? Can you add a paragraph that encourages people to opt-in somewhere on that page or post? 6. Do you have older opt-in offers that you haven’t updated or maintained? If you’ve had webinars or past opt-in offers, decide if you want to forward these pages to your new opt-in or if you need to refresh the thank you page and welcome emails. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00G2QU8MG&amp;location=293">293</a> ^ref-29207</li>

<p>Here are my top tips for writing a great guest post: 1. Start with the core concept of the article, then mind map some of the associated tips, strategies, or ideas.  2. Think of a story you can weave into the article and how it relates to the topic at hand.  3. If noticed themes or a number of ideas that could be subheadings, write them out first as an outline for your post.  4. Write your introduction, then fill in the subsections. Insert your story at the start of the article, or under a sub heading if it’s more specific.  5. Write the conclusion… but don’t fill in your author biography yet, we’ll be covering how to do that in detail in tomorrow’s video.  6. Go back to the title of your article and see if you can make it more specific, memorable, and add in a little curiosity.  7. Finally, go through your article one more time from start to finish to fix an inconsistencies, grammar and typos, and add any missing pieces of information. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00G2QU8MG&amp;location=322">322</a> ^ref-44411</p>
