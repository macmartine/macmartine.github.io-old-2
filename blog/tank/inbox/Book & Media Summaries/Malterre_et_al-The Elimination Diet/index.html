<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>Once the body has identified a food allergen, the immune cells will produce IgE antibodies each time it’s eaten. The antibodies will bind to the allergenic food and also to the immune cells in the local area, causing redness, swelling, heat, pain, and itching. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=413">413</a> ^ref-38515</p>
<hr>
<p>Since the majority of your immune cells are in the gut, digestive issues may also accompany the reaction. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=415">415</a> ^ref-48363</p>
<hr>
<p>Ninety percent of all IgE food allergies in the United States can be attributed to 8 food groups: milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, wheat, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=422">422</a> ^ref-19543</p>
<hr>
<p>When the food drops down from the esophagus into the stomach, it will fall into a pool of gastric acid. This acid breaks apart food and destroys harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites. You want strong stomach acid! — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=587">587</a> ^ref-51187</p>
<hr>
<p>The acidic breakdown is essential for you to access all the vitamins, minerals, proteins, and other nutrients “trapped” in foods. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=591">591</a> ^ref-63249</p>
<hr>
<p>The cells that line the intestinal wall act like “bookends” of the digestion process that occurs within the small intestines. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=647">647</a> ^ref-48662</p>
<hr>
<p>Alcohol, dairy, soy, and high-fructose corn syrup can aggravate intestinal cells, but wheat is the worst. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=655">655</a> ^ref-25484</p>
<hr>
<p>The gallbladder secretes bile to process fats found in foods. It works a bit like dish detergent does on greasy, fatty food remnants by splitting them apart or emulsifying them. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=666">666</a> ^ref-17783</p>
<hr>
<p>These unabsorbed fats can wreak havoc by forming substances that literally “wash” out your intestines, causing looser and floating stools. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=672">672</a> ^ref-61323</p>
<hr>
<p>Enzymes that are released by the pancreas are key to the digestion of proteins, carbs, and fats. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=715">715</a> ^ref-15082</p>
<hr>
<p>If your bowel movements float; are lighter orange, gray, or brown; are urgent, foul smelling, and often looser, this is an indication that you aren’t digesting fats very well and could have a condition call steatorrhea. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=720">720</a> ^ref-50910</p>
<hr>
<p>outside of the wall, the intestinal cells are busy secreting substances like mucus, IgA antibodies, and little antimicrobial peptides that all protect the gut from harm and keep pathogens in check. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=768">768</a> ^ref-51446</p>
<hr>
<p>Wheat and gluten are especially known to irritate the gut. That’s because the carbohydrate-binding proteins in wheat (lectins) decrease the secretion of CCK, — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=793">793</a> ^ref-54982</p>
<hr>
<p>consider. These, in addition to gluten, are the most common things that contribute to a leaky gut: — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=796">796</a> ^ref-15060</p>
<hr>
<p>Alcohol consumption — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=797">797</a> ^ref-5576</p>
<hr>
<p>When alcohol is drunk in excess or on an empty stomach, it can accelerate the development of leaky gut. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=1088">1088</a> ^ref-27031</p>
<hr>
<p>a plant extract supplement derived from turmeric known as Meriva is as effective at lowering pain as acetaminophen (Tylenol). And it doesn’t just lower pain, it also lowers inflammation. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=1763">1763</a> ^ref-54976</p>
<hr>
<p>In short, Meriva lowers pain and inflammation without the adverse side effects of commonly used medication. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=1768">1768</a> ^ref-59960</p>
<hr>
<p>The maintenance dosing of Meriva as an anti-inflammatory is recommended to be 1 to 1.5 grams (1,000 to 1,500 mg) per day. The article on pain reduction showed dosing of 4 grams (4,000 mg). — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00LLIIZAM&amp;location=1769">1769</a> ^ref-7646</p>
