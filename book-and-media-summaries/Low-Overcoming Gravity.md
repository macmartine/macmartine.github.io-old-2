## Highlights
Back in college, I was training using many pushing exercises, such as planche, dips, and handstand pushups, with only a negligible amount of pulling exercises, such as pull-ups. This caused me to develop pain in the front portion of my shoulder, and also provoked my interest in physical therapy and injury prevention. After researching my injury, I saw that there were errors in my training, which I corrected by over exaggeration of pulling exercises and other rehabilitative work until my shoulders were healthy. — location: [1435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG8JZNY7&location=1435) ^ref-11710

My first axiom in bodyweight training is as follows: Keeping the shoulders and shoulder blades operating optimally is the key to bodyweight strength success. — location: [1468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG8JZNY7&location=1468) ^ref-64346

My second axiom of bodyweight training builds off of this point: The shoulder is the lynchpin of the upper body, just as the hip is for the lower body. — location: [1480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG8JZNY7&location=1480) ^ref-11799

The simplest method to maintain shoulder structural balance involves utilizing pull and push exercises, which will offset one another. This will allow you to maintain a healthy balance of strength and hypertrophy at the shoulder. This system works for bodyweight exercises in the vast majority of cases. Pulling and pushing exercises are defined below. — location: [1492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG8JZNY7&location=1492) ^ref-44123

The alternative is additional scapular retraction work or horizontal pulling exercises that focus on pulling the elbows back, in order to squeeze the shoulder blades together, which keeps the pulling and pushing exercises balanced. — location: [1588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG8JZNY7&location=1588) ^ref-18683
