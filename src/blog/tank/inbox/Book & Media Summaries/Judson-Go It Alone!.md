## Highlights
We’ve already discussed three of these: personal leverage, extreme outsourcing, and relentless repeatability, that enable founders to focus on what they do best. — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=249) ^ref-2277

In general, today’s successful entrepreneurs are a surprising mix of prudence and courage: They aren’t afraid to try new things, but they first do everything they can to reduce all costs and risks. — location: [259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=259) ^ref-55874

---
They may take a risk on a new business model or a concept that has not been tried before — and they are not afraid of risk, but within that framework, they do everything they can to limit the costs of failure.” — location: [268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=268) ^ref-60145

---
“The path to success involves staying a little ahead of the competition but close enough that customers can understand your product and incorporate it into their lives and businesses.” — location: [316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=316) ^ref-28594

---
“Years of research shows that the innovations most likely to take hold are those that don’t demand excessive change from the customer.” — location: [318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=318) ^ref-32099

---
The lesson, again, is that to survive and thrive, go-it-alone entrepreneurs must build a paying customer base quickly. To do this, successful entrepreneurs focus on starting businesses that don’t require dramatic shifts in the behavior of customers, suppliers, or service providers. Though such businesses may turn out to be revolutionary change agents, they typically start out as evolutionary improvements with a value that customers can see immediately. — location: [338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=338) ^ref-18785

Go-it-alone entrepreneurs achieve long-term success in part through an ongoing commitment to continuous low-cost innovation and to flexible business systems. — location: [345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=345) ^ref-21507

In a compendium of his work titled The Essential Drucker, he writes that “when a new venture does succeed, more often than not it is in a market other than the one it was originally intended to serve, with products or services not quite those with which it had set out, bought in large part by customers it did not even think of when it started.” — location: [349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=349) ^ref-34436

“Rather than dismiss the unexpected as an ‘exception,’ as entrepreneurs are inclined to do, they need to go out and look at it carefully and as a distinct opportunity.” — location: [356](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=356) ^ref-39002

---
The mantra for each of the businesses discussed above could easily be the same: They develop a quick, inexpensive process for discovering what new products and services potential customers will buy. The benefits here are threefold: (1) They rarely waste precious dollars on failed launches, (2) They limit the time they devote to any unsuccessful initiative, and (3) They view their business as a constantly evolving, flexible system that can maintain its competitive edge. — location: [404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=404) ^ref-14672

Just as you want to design your business with the flexibility to shift your product mix, you also want to be constantly operating live tests of potential improvements in your core business.

Most new products or services are, in reality, incremental improvements on existing ones. In considering this option, there are two important questions to keep in mind: First, put yourself in the place of your target customers. Is your potential new product or service sufficiently better, either in the features it offers or the cost involved, so that customers will shift to your offering from whatever they are using today? Second, what happens to your proposed business if existing participants in this arena quickly match your improvement in response to the threat of your offering? It’s a tremendous plus for your business opportunity if you have a valid reason to believe this type of fast competitive response is unlikely, or impossible, in the business area you are assessing. — location: [1254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC2KJW&location=1254) ^ref-6054
