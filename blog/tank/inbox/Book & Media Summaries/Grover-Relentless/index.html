<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>That is a Cleaner. You don’t have to love the hard work; you just have to crave the end result. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=91">91</a> ^ref-50849</p>

<p>The whole point of this book is that in order to be successful, to truly have what you want in your life, you must stop waiting be told what to do and how to do it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=107">107</a> ^ref-63739</p>
<hr>
<p>I can’t give you a ten-step process or a checklist for accomplishing your goals; no one can do that for you, nor should you ask them to. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=108">108</a> ^ref-47798</p>

<p>You just need to share their relentless drive for the end result. And let nothing stand in your way of achieving it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=116">116</a> ^ref-52624</p>

<p>Being relentless means never being satisfied. It means creating new goals every time you reach your personal best. If you’re good, it means you don’t stop until you’re great. If you’re great, it means you fight until you’re unstoppable. It means becoming a Cleaner. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=299">299</a> ^ref-14781</p>

<p>Cleaners understand they don’t have to love the work to be successful; they just have to be relentless about achieving it, and everything else in between — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=373">373</a> ^ref-53874</p>

<p>• Cleaners make the competition study them; they don’t care whom they’re facing, they know they can handle anyone. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=417">417</a> ^ref-44824</p>

<p>Physical dominance can make you great. Mental dominance is what ultimately makes you unstoppable. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=488">488</a> ^ref-17807</p>

<p>You will never have a more powerful training tool than this: get your mind strong, so your body can follow. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=489">489</a> ^ref-46705</p>
<hr>
<p>Do. The. Work. Every day, you have to do something you don’t want to do. Every day. Challenge yourself to be uncomfortable, push past the apathy and laziness and fear. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=523">523</a> ^ref-6104</p>

<p>Bottom line if you want success of any kind: you have to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Every time you think you can’t, you have to do it anyway. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=551">551</a> ^ref-29544</p>

<p>That last mile, the last set, the last five minutes on the clock. You have to play the last game of the season with the same intensity as you played the first. When your body is screaming and depleted and telling you, “No way, asshole,” you work harder and tell yourself, “Do it. Now.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=552">552</a> ^ref-54814</p>

<p>Explain to me: If you can choose between being uncomfortable because you’re overweight and sick, or uncomfortable because you’re sweating at the gym three times a week, why do so many people choose the discomfort that leads to complete physical failure? — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=611">611</a> ^ref-39714</p>
<hr>
<p>You’re not thinking, because thinking turns your thoughts on to everything, and the Zone is about the opposite, turning your thoughts off to everything except the task at hand. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=787">787</a> ^ref-34690</p>

<p>The only exception to the emotions rule is anger: controlled anger is a deadly weapon, in the right hands. I’m not talking about a raging volcano that can’t be managed from inside or outside, but anger you can restrain and turn into energy. All Cleaners have that slow-burning, blue-hot internal anger, and it works if they can control and maintain it. But it never becomes blind rage, and it’s never allowed to become destructive. When you channel anger the right way, you get Michael shaking his head in Vancouver and annihilating the game. He didn’t slug anyone, he stayed steady and unemotional and turned his quiet anger into results. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=814">814</a> ^ref-2972</p>

<p>A Cleaner thinks, If I’m feeling nervous, how the fuck are they feeling? They have to deal with me. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=827">827</a> ^ref-50922</p>
<hr>
<p>Then why are you still questioning your ability to do it? Quick answer: because at some point, you made something simple into something complicated, and you stopped trusting yourself. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=892">892</a> ^ref-61862</p>

<p>on, no instincts, no chance for success. When you become too focused on what’s going on around you, you lose touch with what’s going on deep inside you. Those are the guys who are perfect in practice, but blow it when it counts. They can’t find the Zone, they’re distracted by their own thought process, and they don’t trust themselves. They’re thinking about everything that can go wrong, thinking about what everyone else is doing, thinking instead of knowing, without a doubt, I got this. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=934">934</a> ^ref-64379</p>

<p>matter what was coming at him, he was ready. Like all Cleaners, he didn’t study the competition, he made the competition study him. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=943">943</a> ^ref-40204</p>

<p>to wait to see what would happen. He already knew. Stop waiting to be taught something you already know. How many millions of diet and exercise books are sold every year? I promise you, every single person who picks up one of those books already knows the answer: eat healthier and move your body. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=967">967</a> ^ref-58842</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m not telling you to stop searching for answers. But learn about yourself, and then trust what you know so you can build on what you already have. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=973">973</a> ^ref-55311</p>

<p>There is zero chance you’ll get anywhere if you allow yourself to become paralyzed by soft excuses and countless reasons why you’ll never get to where you want to be. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=1006">1006</a> ^ref-16674</p>
<hr>
<p>Trust your gut to navigate the hard road to get there. The satisfaction and sense of achievement will blow your mind when you finally arrive, knowing you arrived on your own with only your instincts to guide you. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=1007">1007</a> ^ref-23277</p>

<p>Cleaner Law: control your dark side, don’t let it control you. Do you want to smoke or do you have to smoke? All that nightlife—do you know when it’s time to head home, or is it crushing your game? Do you drink because you like it or because you need it to cope with the pressure you feel? Can you be decent at what you do with an alcohol problem? Probably. But you can’t be great. Cleaners never perform under the influence of anything; they place too much value on their mental state to allow anything to affect their minds and instincts and reflexes. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B008O58LL8&amp;location=1160">1160</a> ^ref-25997</p>
