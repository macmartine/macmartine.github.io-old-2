  <article><h2>AWS to Render</h2>
<p>When faced with a decision of any kind, I always try to choose the simplest option.</p>
<p>Sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail, only to recognize this later.</p>
<p>I recently realized that I'm spending way too much time with DevOps on AWS for Aware. Being on AWS made sense partly because we got a $10k startup credit there. But it's become time-sucking, and some of the day-to-day tasks I need to do related to this tend to take more time than I'd like.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'm trying to get better at delegating, so it makes sense to explore moving Aware from AWS to a PaaS. In exploring options I narrowed it down to fly.io, render.com, railsway.app, and of course Heroku as a fallback, simply because it seems to be by far the most expensive, however it's been around the longest so is potentially the most stable and robust.</p>
<p>I tried fly.io and liked it, until I saw the forums and noticed almost nothing but a list of issues related to simple things on the platform, and they weren't getting responses. I tried my hand at support and had a very poor experience, so I moved on. I'm now a few days into trying render.com, and so far so good. I got the app up and running (Rails, Postgres, Redis, Sidekiq) super fast. And I asked a question in the support community and got a sufficient answer within minutes.</p>
<p>I don't know why I didn't do this sooner. I even think it may end up costing less than AWS, but even if it's double, I expect to be happy as I'll view is as the cost of delegating out the DevOps that I'm tired of fighting.</p>
