Focus on decisions in the top-right quadrant - consequential and irreversible.

If decision is inconsequential or irreversible we can change our minds easily. Little impact on life.

	**Lead Dominoes:**

Consequential and irreversible decisions are those that change the trajectory of our life.
- Who we marry
- If we have kids
- Where we live
- Which house of business to buy
- Career

Type 1 decisions: Lead Dominoes
Type 2 decisions: All other quadrants

Type 2 decisions can often be delegated

The fewer the consequences, the lower down in the organization the decision can be delegated

Break is down into smaller decisions - those will generally fall in other quadrants.
Gather information, ask other, give things a trial run.
