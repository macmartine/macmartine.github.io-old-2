<p>To start with, your goal should be to warm people up as fast as you can and build trust — NOT to close them on first email.   The money is almost never in the first email, so you have to think about relationship building instead. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=250">250</a> ^ref-61069</p>

<p>If you follow the advice in this book, you should expect a response rate of between 20 percent and 30 percent with no effort. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=265">265</a> ^ref-42677</p>

<p>Here’s how to measure your cold email efforts, so that you can get a good sense of how you’re doing. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=302">302</a> ^ref-61301</p>

<p>Quantity never beats quality. When you do manage to get the quality you need, you can look at how to increase quantity -- not the opposite. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=335">335</a> ^ref-32180</p>

<p>The only problem is that you don’t get email addresses until you are connected. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=407">407</a> ^ref-56308</p>

<p>Another technique is to join groups your prospects belong to and simply send them a message. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=412">412</a> ^ref-62065</p>

<p>With LinkedIn searches, you can easily build a highly targeted and accurate list of prospects to contact with minimum intellectual effort. For example: “Founder of a SaaS company,” “Financial planner in a company of less than five employees,” and so on. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=414">414</a> ^ref-22162</p>

<p>If all else fails, you can still get people’s email addresses with a few tools. For example, prospecthive.com or SalesLoft.com. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=416">416</a> ^ref-16155</p>

<p>When contacting brick and mortar companies, Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/) or other local directories can be of great help. The process would be to determine the company and then figure out the right person to contact in that company (similar to getting a list of tech websites). — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=425">425</a> ^ref-37752</p>

<p>Companies such as LeadGenius.com specialize in exactly this. So, if you have some money and don’t mind outsourcing how prospects are contacted, this may be a good alternative for your business. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=462">462</a> ^ref-26157</p>

<p>The promise is that if people don’t open your email, they won’t reply. For sure, but what data tells me is that subject lines act more as filters to prevent reading rather than a priority list.   What I mean by that is that people don’t seem to be that selective about the emails they read. They do delete emails with subjects that appear to have failed their personal filter, though. For example, mentioning “Make money fast while working at home” won’t help your open rate in a B2B setup. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=532">532</a> ^ref-60161</p>

<p>“Quick question” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=550">550</a> ^ref-12731</p>

<p>“Coffee maybe?”, “Meeting today?” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=553">553</a> ^ref-55190</p>

<p>The first touch should be to pre-qualify, get a name to follow up with, and then reach out to engage in conversation. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=574">574</a> ^ref-62806</p>

<p>When you need a higher response rate, lower the commitment. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=605">605</a> ^ref-37844</p>
<hr>
<p>In essence, ask your readers to do something so easy that they can’t refuse. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=606">606</a> ^ref-36470</p>

<p>“Reply <em>yes</em> and I’ll send you more information” - No need to type back three pages, just <em>yes</em>. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=607">607</a> ^ref-24236</p>
<hr>
<p>Another tactic is to add links and ask them to click on the correct one. Then, once they click, you can engage more deeply with them. Low commitments will allow for bigger ones later. “Hey, thanks for letting me know. I have another question I wanted to ask…” Could be a great follow-up to the prospect clicking a link. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=611">611</a> ^ref-49402</p>

<p>Reciprocity is a powerful vector of goodwill. In short, it relies on giving without expecting anything in return. People will then feel the desire to reciprocate the favor one way or another in bigger terms.   To harness this, you need to find out what is of value to your prospects (not to you) and give it to them. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=628">628</a> ^ref-7522</p>

<p>Advanced users will link it with Google Analytics using utm_source, utm_campaign, utm_medium and utm_content so that the cold email campaign’s traffic will be visible in Google Analytics. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=642">642</a> ^ref-36039</p>
<hr>
<p>You should always use utm_source, utm_medium, and utm_campaign parameters to help keep track of different campaigns. utm_term and utm_content can be used for tracking additional information. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=648">648</a> ^ref-1429</p>

<p>You can also use links as substitutes for replies. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=659">659</a> ^ref-14538</p>

<p>Imagine you have your list of prospects. You can then import them as your target audience for a Facebook ad. Your prospects will be exposed to your brand via a well-crafted ad.   A few days after (whether they click on the ad), you start your cold email sequence (including a Facebook tracking pixel). People may then remember having seen your brand somewhere already and you can track success with that Facebook pixel. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=697">697</a> ^ref-8865</p>

<p>In summary, here you go, here is the magic formula to get responses:   1. Get your audience right. Find people who want to hear your offer.   2. Find ways to pre-warm the message (likeness works wonders).   3. Use simple subject lines.   4. Be short, to-the-point, and crystal clear as to what your value proposition is.   5. Make sure you talk to one person.   6. Ask for a low commitment call to action.   7. Follow-up relentlessly.   After that, a 40 percent reply rate should be easy to get. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=704">704</a> ^ref-8303</p>

<p>Of course, open rate will vary depending on your market and business type, but if you have a business that gets clients via email, you should have an open rate of at least 60 percent. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00X7THBWG&amp;location=717">717</a> ^ref-43534</p>
