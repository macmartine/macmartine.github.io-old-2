### Backstory

#### Your problem or challenge

Wanted control of my time. Hated meetings, hated having to be places at a certain time. Hated having to sit at a desk for 8 hours a day regardless of what I was getting done.

Wanted to be able to get rewarded for my efforts. The harded I worked, the more money I made for someone else.

#### Internal struggles

I wasn't sure what to make. Tried to marry my passions with something I could sell and make money off of. I was thinking of ideas that were too big. I should have started with smaller things. Make $1 this month, etc.

#### External struggles

I saw people all around making a living building products. 

#### What was your change event?

I created the podcast.

I stopped caring if I was passionate about this idea. I started talking to people and getting better and listening for the actual pains, not 'cool feature ideas'.

#### What was the spark?

I realized the people that were successful we just ordinary people. They weren't necessarily smarter than me, nor did they have more valuable skills than me, or skills I didn't have. They just kept trying things, and eventually something hit.

#### Who was your guide?

Books and podcasts and blogs were my guide.

#### What was the result? I kept at it, and eventually probability played out.

### Polarization

Have strong opinions. Don't be wishy-washy.

### Tell a story

Make a powerful statement to start: "I left to rat race"

Second line is a head-scratcher: "My secret sauce is less ambition"

Tell real stories.

### Todo:

Craft 3-5 relatable lessions

## Lesson 2:  Content Creation

### Choosing content paths

It's important for my audience to view me as a trusted expert in knowledge.

#### Path 1: Leading

Leadership comes from experience. Aimed at folks behind you on their journey.

#### Path 2: Discovering your tribe

Discover secrets of successful people on behalf of your audience.

Great for people that don't have experience.

#### Path 3: Reporting to your tribe

Requires access to people who are interesting: Uncover ultimate truths by interviewing experts, authorities, and other people in your industry.

### The New & Improved Content Matrix

#### Step 1: Define the outcome

For me:
- Get email subscribers
- Sell products

#### Step 2: Themes

- Pricing
- Customer development
- Marketing
- Idea generation
- When to pivot
- Messaging
- Targeting
- Work/life balance


#### Step 3: The styles

- Observations
- Actionable
- Motivational
- Analytical
- Contrarian
- X vs. Y
- Present / Future
- Listicle


### Rapid Content Iteration

How: Combine topics with styles and structures:

**Examples:**
- Automation (Topic) + Observations (Style/structure)
- Customer drips + Actionable
- Sales emails + Motivational

### Copywriting 101

**Goal:**
Get reader to:
- Stop scrolling
  - Create the "meat": Teach, show, suggest
  - Break the scroll with the first line
- Read content
  - Make each line intriguing enough to read the next one
  - Scroll stopper -> Interest builder -> Hook line
- Engage in conversation
  - Wrap it up with a summary, then Call To Conversation (CTC)

**How:**
Take 8 content ideas to serve as outline for 2 weeks of content

### Daily Content Workflow

**Goal:**
Get early engagement; Better chance for long-term survival

**How:**
- Schedule (post at same time)
- Audience cheats - let your audience know when you post
- Share link to recent content and ask people to bookmark it
- **Get accountability partner** to keep you posting and help your content
  - You post -> They hover (til bubbles pop up) and read
  - They react
  - They comment
  - They click through to profile

### Listening for customer problems

After being active, people will start reaching out

## Lesson 3:  Building Your Tribe

### Smart Audience Interaction

1) When people comment on my posts, ask them questions to keep it going

2) Engage with top performers in my Industry

3) Who is that for me?
  - Audience building experts
  - Creators

4) When I find those people, ask them when they post

5) Try to be first to post **with value**

6) Form a relationship (after been engaging for a while)
  - Send a recommendation
  - Teach them something, share something with no expectations

### Finding Relevant People

#### Advanced Filtering

1) Search i.e. "Audience building"
- Filters: 'services'

- Find people with 3k+ followers
- That are active on LI

2) Use SparkToro with a relevant marketer
- Finds high-quality people related to that person

3) Twitter advanced search
- Exclude replies
- Search i.e. audience building
- Minimum number of likes,  say 250
- Add these people on LI

## Lesson 4: The Profile Funnel

- Make it easy to understand what I do in 2 seconds
- Present myself in a solutions-oriented fashion
- Offer free insights in featured CTA section
- Provide further proof in About section

### Funnel
-> Read content on LinkeDIn
-> Visit profile
-> Read banner 
-> Read tagline and hashtags
-> Checks Featured sections
-> Reads about
-> Follows

Put social proof in the middle of the About section

Featured section ideals has two items, one for top of funnel (i.e. free content gated with email capture), and bottom of funnel (product for sale)

## Lesson 5: The Outbound Strategy

## Engage with prospects

1) Find 10-15 prospects, add decision-maker to list
2) Engage on their posts with value

## Google Alerts

Set up alerts for prospects names or anything else relevant, to support a DM

## Lesson 6: Selling on LinkedIn

Any ask "drains the battery"

Make an ask no more than 90/10 or 80/20

Types of posts:
-> Awareness: Entertaining
-> Information: Teaching things
-> Selling post

Entertaining posts get the most engagement, but least people take action

Information gets lower engagement, but more action

Sell through urgency and FOMO

### Methodologies

1) Low-ticket tripwire to funnel: Something cheap, add email to nurture to middle-tier. Start with this one.

2) The expiring offer: 80% high-quality content, 20% asking for purchase. Use after building trust with audience.
