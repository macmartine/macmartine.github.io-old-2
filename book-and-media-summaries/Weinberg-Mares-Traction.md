## Highlights
I built a karma widget that would display links to your social media profiles and how many followers you had on each service. People would embed it on their sites and at the bottom there would be a link back to DuckDuckGo that said “new search engine.” — location: [82](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=82) ^ref-28724

In fact, often the most underutilized channels in an industry are the most promising ones. — location: [132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=132) ^ref-11669

---
Get one channel working that your competitors dismiss, and you can grow rapidly while they languish. — location: [143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=143) ^ref-37524

Engineering as Marketing Using engineering resources to acquire customers is a significantly underutilized way to get traction. Successful companies have built microsites, developed widgets, and created free tools that drive thousands of leads each month. We asked Dharmesh Shah, founder of HubSpot, to discuss how engineering as marketing has driven HubSpot’s growth to tens of thousands of customers through tools like its Marketing Grader. — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=175) ^ref-52259

---
Traction and product development are of equal importance and should each get about half of your attention. This is what we call the 50 percent rule: spend 50 percent of your time on product and 50 percent on traction. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=228) ^ref-56435

---
As you hone your product, you are effectively plugging leaks. Once you have crossed over to phase II, you have product-market fit and customers are sticking around. Now is the time to scale up your traction efforts: your bucket is no longer leaky. You are now fine-tuning your positioning and marketing messages. — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=294) ^ref-64897

---
In phase I, it’s getting those first customers that prove your product can get traction. In phase II, it is getting enough customers that you’re knocking on the door of sustainability. And in phase III, your focus is on increasing your earnings, scaling your marketing channels, and creating a truly sustainable business. — location: [299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=299) ^ref-27726

---
Phase I is very product focused and involves pursuing initial traction while also building your initial product. This often means getting traction in ways that don’t scale—giving talks, writing guest posts, emailing people you have relationships with, attending conferences, and doing whatever you can to get in front of customers. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=301) ^ref-27809

A lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don’t. You build something, make it available, and if you’ve made a better mousetrap, people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don’t, in which case the market must not exist. Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off. . . . The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can’t wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them. — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=305) ^ref-58008

If you are considering a pivot, the first thing to look for is evidence of real product engagement, even if it is only a few dedicated customers. If you have such engagement, you might be giving up too soon. You should examine these bright spots to see how they might be expanded. Why do these customers take to your product so well? Is there some thread that unites them? Are they early adopters in a huge market or are they outliers? The answers to these questions may reveal some promise that is not immediately evident in your core metrics. — location: [348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=348) ^ref-6813

---
Set your growth goals. Focus on strategies and tactics that can plausibly move the needle for your company. Get some hard numbers. — location: [361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=361) ^ref-44597

---
Find your bright spots. If you’re not seeing the traction you want, look for bright spots in your customer base, pockets of customers who are truly engaged with your product. See if you can figure out why it works for them and if you can expand from that base. If there are no bright spots, it may be a good time to pivot. — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=365) ^ref-41901

Poor distribution—not product—is the number one cause of failure. — location: [376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=376) ^ref-14878

In terms of research to feed your brainstorm, this book is a good start, but you should get much more specific to your company. You should know what marketing strategies have worked in your industry, as well as the history of companies in your space. It’s especially important to understand how similar companies acquired customers over time, and how unsuccessful companies wasted their marketing dollars. — location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=388) ^ref-10025

With limited resources, it’s almost impossible to optimize multiple channel strategies at once. Running ten social ads and testing everything about them (ad copy, landing pages, etc.) is a full-time endeavor. That is optimization, not testing. Rather, you should be running several cheap tests (perhaps two social ads with two landing pages) that give some indication of how successful a given channel strategy could be. In other words, you should not be getting too deep into tactics at this stage; stick to the strategy level. — location: [486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=486) ^ref-24030

---
change, reap the benefits, and run another test. Making A/B testing a habit (even if you run just one test a week) will improve your efficiency in a traction channel by two or three times. There are many tools to help you do this type of testing online, such as Optimizely, Visual Website Optimizer, and Unbounce. — location: [509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=509) ^ref-56500

However, the company that leverages a newer platform that’s growing quickly will have a significant advantage over companies chasing the same old methods. — location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=533) ^ref-10602

---
The right goal is highly dependent on your business. It should be chosen carefully and align with your company strategy. You want a goal where hitting the mark would change things significantly for your company’s outcome. Perhaps you’d be profitable, be able to raise money more easily, or become the market leader. — location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=584) ^ref-5816

---
The path to reaching your traction goal with the fewest number of steps is your Critical Path. You should literally enumerate the intermediate steps (milestones) to get to your traction goal. These milestones need not be traction related, but they should be absolutely necessary to reach your goal. — location: [601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=601) ^ref-2848

Run tests on a variety of smaller blogs. — location: [739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=739) ^ref-36290

---
Offer something unique to your best targets. Build a special offer just for them and put together a draft guest post that they can run with. — location: [743](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=743) ^ref-61339

---
It’s better to start smaller when targeting big media outlets. For them, the direct approach is rarely the best approach. Instead, you approach obliquely. So you find the blogs that TechCrunch reads and gets story ideas from. Chances are it will be easier to get that blog’s attention. — location: [766](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=766) ^ref-43714

---
Tech startups frequently get exposure this way. Sites like TechCrunch and Lifehacker often pick up stories from smaller forums like Hacker News and subreddits. In turn, The New York Times often picks up content from TechCrunch and wraps it into a larger narrative they’re telling. — location: [777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=777) ^ref-3678

---
Affiliate programs are popular with financial services and insurance companies because the value of each customer is so high. — location: [2315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TY3ZOMS&location=2315) ^ref-64722
