## Highlights
The advantage of a largely unwired-in nervous system to a human being is that it enables tremendous flexibility in relation to behavioral options. In other words, we can learn to adapt to an unlimited number of cultural environments, languages, climates, and so on. — location: [174](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZKT5C&location=174) ^ref-56553

The central idea behind all we are discussing is the following: The mental and physical components of any action are two different aspects of the same function. The physical and mental components are not two series of phenomena, which are somehow linked together; but, rather, they are two aspects of the same thing, like two faces of the same coin. — location: [634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZKT5C&location=634) ^ref-38807

What is important is that thinking involves a physical function which supports the mental process. No matter how closely we look, it is difficult to find a mental act that can take place without the support of some physical function. — location: [652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZKT5C&location=652) ^ref-62131

The state of wakeful consciousness is made up of four elements: movements, sensations, feelings, and thoughts. If these four activities are absent, one soon falls asleep. It is taken as a matter of fact that movement and sensation are central nervous system functions; but, beyond this, we are proposing that mental process is the same kind of function. And we shall attempt to show that feelings are also functions of the central nervous system. — location: [668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZKT5C&location=668) ^ref-42375

Thus, we have established what is the underlying pattern in the formation of anxiety complexes, ingrained states of fear, indecisiveness, and chronic self-doubt. Additionally, we have pointed out the interdependence of feelings on the one hand and central nervous system functions on the other hand, showing how they affect bodily posture and create typical patterns of muscular tonus. — location: [690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZKT5C&location=690) ^ref-17031

In summing up, we would like to reiterate how crucial the control of musculature is in the control of self. Careful examination of habitual posture, and the patterns of muscular contraction causing it, make it possible to infer which areas of the motor cortex are subject to ongoing abnormal excitation and which areas are subject to ongoing inhibition. — location: [694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZKT5C&location=694) ^ref-40467

---
if one’s whole state of ongoing excitations and inhibitions is such that every thought and action always activates the same regions, we have a good description of the state of obsession. Such states of the nervous system can be smoothed out to normalcy by drugs which act upon the same regions of excitation and inhibition. When similar results sometimes occur in psychotherapy, they are attended by changes in both posture and general muscular tonus. — location: [700](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZKT5C&location=700) ^ref-55235

In fact, the factor limiting movements of the body in general should be the skeleton structure and not muscular tightness. Actually, every adult uses only a part of the theoretical possibilities of the human frame. — location: [797](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZKT5C&location=797) ^ref-28295

Very often one half—the right or left—is worked with during a lesson, and the other half is left as it was. Again, for hours afterwards, pupils carry with them two standards in their bodies—their habitual one, and the proposed better one. They keep feeling the difference until the clumsy side eases up. In this way students learn to ease up, so to speak, from within. This promotes the transfer of learning from the action worked on, to other actions, completely different. The transfer of learning is essentially — location: [905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZKT5C&location=905) ^ref-50822

Another principle in the group technique is the scanning of the body image, which is done in two parallel ways. One way consists of producing a sensation of length, width, and lightness in one side of the body, by actually moving the body, as explained above. The other half of the body is brought to feel the same sensation by mental scanning alone. The mental scanning consists of listening and becoming aware of the difference of sensation in the motor memory of the muscles of the two halves, and the sensation of change of orientation in space. The other way consists of scanning the body on both sides from the start, directing attention to the sensation of the distances between different parts of the body on either side until these sensations correspond to the actual difference. — location: [910](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004ZZKT5C&location=910) ^ref-56918
