## Highlights
In some ways, they are not conscious because they do not live consciously. They are out of touch with who they really are. They have lost themselves, their soul identity. They are shells of their real self. But, on the other hand, judging, criticizing, and manipulating are conscious acts. The more jealous they get of you, the more they demean you. To belittle and demean is a conscious act. â€” location: [2326](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078KXGS98&location=2326) ^ref-33923
