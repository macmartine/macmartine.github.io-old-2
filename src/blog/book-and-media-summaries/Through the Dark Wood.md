**[Section 1](about:blank#Section%201)**

Collision of false self and true self

We see ourselves through your prism of our surroundings

3 elements of human psychology

- Character (inherent, sometimes developed)
- Prism of Family forge(?) and organic culture - Biased vision
- Hubris - tendency to inflate ourselves

We wind up in the dark wood, deluding ourselves, not realizing the other forces at work

False self - patterns

- In service to fear of overwhelment
- Our responses:
    - Message we get is: I'm relatively powerless in this world
        - Avoidance
        - So we project on to others
        - Distract ourselves
        - Suppress
        - Disassociate
        - These can become personality disorders if too invasive
- Power complex: Seek power over others
- Compliance
- And abandonment
- We have a Deficit, so either:
    - Self sabotage
    - Overcompensate (need to show how awesome we are)
- Power complex
    - Narcissist - use others to compensate
- Questions to answer
    - Where has life been unfair to me?
    - Where did those things lead me?
    - Where have I been gifted, blessed?
    - What have I done with that fortune?
    - Where am I rigid and resistance to change?
        - Those are fears
    - Where am I blocked by fear?
    - What is the fear beneath the fear? Abandonment? Lack of support? This is the core/archaic fear to track to.
    - What are the primary learned fears?
        - Fear controls most of our lives
    - Where was my father/mother stuck? Did I get stuck in same place?
    - Where do I avoid conflict?
    - What are things/habits/behavioral patterns holding me back?
    - What task are these helping me avoid?
    - Where in my life am I still asking for permission?
    - Where do I need to grow up?
    - What have I always felt called to but not done? (Since childhood)N
    - What new life wants to emerge through me?
