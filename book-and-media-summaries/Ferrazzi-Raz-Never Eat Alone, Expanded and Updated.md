## Highlights
I learned that real networking was about finding ways to make other people more successful. It was about working hard to give more than you get. — location: [250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=250) ^ref-11554

---
Until you become as willing to ask for help as you are to give it, however, you are only working half the equation. — location: [331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=331) ^ref-50349

---
Bottom line: It’s better to give before you receive. And never keep score. If your interactions are ruled by generosity, your rewards will follow suit. — location: [439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=439) ^ref-57740

Contribute. It’s like Miracle-Gro for networks. Give your time, money, and expertise to your growing community of friends. — location: [447](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=447) ^ref-44327

We all have our own loves, insecurities, strengths, weaknesses, and unique capabilities. And we have to take those into account in figuring out where our talents and desires intersect. That intersection is what I call your “blue flame”—where passion and ability come together. When that blue flame is ignited within a person, it is a powerful force in getting you where you want to go. — location: [494](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=494) ^ref-20122

There are two aspects to getting good information. One part comes from within you; the other part comes from those around you. — location: [512](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=512) ^ref-49608

The most simple version of the plan is separated into three distinct parts: The first part is devoted to the development of the goals that will help you fulfill your mission. The second part is devoted to connecting those goals to the people, places, and things that will help you get the job done. And the third part helps you determine the best way to reach out to the people who will help you to accomplish your goals. This means choosing a medium to connect, but, more important, it means finding a way to lead with generosity. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=548) ^ref-20828

“I’m going into politics and plan to run for governor of Arkansas, and I’m keeping track of everyone I meet,” said Clinton. That story, recounted by Stamps, epitomizes Bill Clinton’s forthright approach to reaching out and including others in his mission. He knew, even then, that he wanted to run for office, and his sense of purpose emboldened his efforts with both passion and sincerity. In fact, as an undergraduate at Georgetown, the forty-second president made it a nightly habit to record, on index cards, the names and vital information of every person whom he’d met that day. — location: [706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=706) ^ref-40820

He asked me to lunch one day looking for advice and encouragement. Ten minutes after we sat down, I knew he was on the wrong track. “Have you started to reach out to potential clients?” I asked. “No,” he told me. “I’m taking it step by step. My plan is to work my way up in my current company to a point where I can afford to leave. Then I’ll incorporate, get an office, and start searching for my first customers. I don’t want to start meeting with potential clients until I can present myself as a credible PR person with my own firm.” “You’ve got it totally backward,” I told him. “You’re setting yourself up for failure.” My advice was to start finding future clients today. Had he thought about what kind of industry he wanted to specialize in? Had he thought about where the top people in that industry hang out? Once he could answer those questions, the next step was to go hang with this new circle of people. “The most important thing is to get to know these people as friends, not potential customers,” I said. “Though you’re right about one thing: No matter how friendly you are, if the people you approach are any good at what they do, they won’t hire you right off the bat to do their PR. Which is why you should offer your services for free—at least at first. For instance, maybe you can volunteer your time to a nonprofit organization they’re involved in, or aid in publicizing a school fund-raiser their kids are involved in.” — location: [734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=734) ^ref-7950

“Absolutely,” I said. “Today you are unproven, and breaking in is tough. Eventually, you’ll have a growing circle of people who have seen your work and who believe in you. Those are the kinds of connections you’re looking to create if you’re going to start a business, or if you’re looking to change jobs or careers. — location: [751](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=751) ^ref-3518

There are a number of things that you can do to harness the power of your preexisting network. Have you investigated the friends and contacts of your parents? How about your siblings? Your friends from college and grad school? What about your church, bowling league, or gym? How about your doctor or lawyer or Realtor or broker? — location: [787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=787) ^ref-53072

Any hobby is an opportunity to get involved: stamp collecting, singing, sports, literature. Clubs develop around all of these interests. Join up. Become an active member. When you feel up to it, become one of the leaders of the group. — location: [877](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=877) ^ref-21289

---
Before I meet with any new people I’ve been thinking of introducing myself to, I research who they are and what their business is. I find out what’s important to them: their hobbies, challenges, goals—inside their business and out. Before the meeting, I generally prepare, or have my assistant prepare, a one-page synopsis on the person I’m about to meet. The only criterion for what should be included is that I want to know what this person is like as a human being, what he or she feels strongly about, and what his or her proudest achievements are. — location: [1051](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1051) ^ref-51074

---
Sure, you should also be up-to-date on what’s happening within the company of a person you want to establish a relationship with. Did the person have a good or bad quarter? Does the company have a new product? Trust me, all people naturally care, generally above and beyond anything else, about what it is they do. If you are informed enough to step comfortably into their world and talk knowledgeably, their appreciation will be tangible. As William James wrote: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” — location: [1055](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1055) ^ref-59034

---
The point is, once you’ve done everything you can to prepare, you still have to reach beyond the odd collection of data points that add up to our public identity and get to someone as an individual. Find a way to become part of those things that are of most interest to them, and you will have found a way to become part of their life. — location: [1079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1079) ^ref-22731

---
I never shy away from mentioning the research I’ve done. “I always make a special effort to inquire about the people I’d like to meet.” Inevitably, people are flattered. Wouldn’t you be? Instantly, the other person knows that rather than suffering through a strained half hour with a stranger, they’re able to connect with someone with whom they share an interest, someone who has gone out of his way to get to know them better. — location: [1129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1129) ^ref-1992

To create excitement around our product, I wrote down a list of people I called “influentials”: the early adopters, journalists, and industry analysts who help spread the initial buzz about a product or service. Next, I made a list of potential customers, potential acquirers, and people who might be interested in funding us down the road. (In creating your own categories, each should correspond to your own goals.) When you make such lists, it’s important you name the actual decision makers, and not just an organization. The point here is to have a readily accessible and specific list of names. At the outset, concentrate on the people who are already part of your existing network. I bet you have no idea how vast and widespread it really is. Take the time to list people such as: Relatives Friends of relatives All your spouse’s relatives and contacts Current colleagues Members of professional and social organizations Current and former customers and clients Parents of your children’s friends Neighbors, past and present People you went to school with People you have worked with in the past People in your religious congregation Former teachers and employers People you socialize with People who provide services to you People with whom you interact on Facebook Other online connections in social media or community groups Next, I enter the gathered names into a database. To note, LinkedIn now lets you aggregate contacts whether they’re LinkedIn members or not, and then see your communications with them across all major platforms. Very useful. I then create call sheets by region, listing the people I know and those I want to know. A variety of contact aggregators make it easy to sort your lists. When I’m in a given town, I’ll try to phone as many people as I can. I carry these lists around with me wherever I go. They focus my efforts in cabs between meetings. I have something palpable to encourage me to reach out. If paper’s not for you, you can do the same thing with any number of mobile apps. Some of the lists you create will be related to your action plans; others are more general, helping you to stay connected. The way you organize your lists can be fluid. I have lists by geographical location, by industry, by activity (other runners, for instance, or people who like to go out on the town), whether they’re an acquaintance or friend, and so on. — location: [1170](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1170) ^ref-38650

It’s the Holy Grail of networking! If you haven’t recently taken time to connect to people on LinkedIn, mark down two hours on your calendar this week to send out personalized invites to as many people in your network as you have time for. You’ll be surprised at how many new conversations you can start by making a simple LinkedIn request. — location: [1213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1213) ^ref-22984

---
There’s another category you might want to add, something I call my “aspirational contacts.” There are those extremely high-level people who have nothing to do with my business at hand but are just, well, interesting or successful or both. The people on that list may be anyone from heads of state and media moguls, to artists and actors, to people others speak highly of. I list these people, too. — location: [1216](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1216) ^ref-15233

---
When I call someone directly whom I haven’t spoken with before, I try to call at an unusual time. Someone who is busy is more likely to pick up his own phone at 8:00 A.M. or 6:30 P.M. Plus, he’s probably less stressed out since he’s not facing typical nine-to-five pressures. — location: [1265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1265) ^ref-7324

I called in the early morning, but got Serge’s voice mail. So I left a message: “I just want to reiterate my excitement regarding our meeting. I’ve never heard John talk so flatteringly of a business associate. I understand how busy you must be. I haven’t heard from your administrative assistant, but I’m sure I will. See you soon.” At no point do you want your interactions to become strained. Creating and maintaining a sense of optimism and gentle pressure around the appointment is all part of the dance. — location: [1268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1268) ^ref-32841

In fifteen seconds, I used my four rules for what I call warm calling: (1) Convey credibility by mentioning a familiar person or institution—in this case, John, Jeff, and WebMD. (2) State your value proposition: Jeff’s new product would help Serge sell his new products. (3) Impart urgency and convenience by being prepared to do whatever it takes whenever it takes to meet the other person on his or her own terms. (4) Be prepared to offer a compromise that secures a definite follow-up at a minimum. — location: [1278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1278) ^ref-42524

---
Credibility is the first thing you want to establish in any interaction, and, ultimately, no one will buy from you unless you establish trust. — location: [1293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1293) ^ref-44254

Selling is, reduced to its essence, solving another person’s problems. And you can do that only when you know what those problems are. — location: [1314](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1314) ^ref-1035

---
Here’s what you need to know beyond the rules I’ve already laid out to get responses from “warm” e-mails. — location: [1343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1343) ^ref-5137

---
My point? Always respect the gatekeeper’s power. Treat them with the dignity they deserve. If you do, doors will open for you even to the most powerful decision makers. What does it mean to treat them with dignity? Acknowledge their help. Thank them by phone, or with flowers or a note. — location: [1426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1426) ^ref-34378

In building a network, remember: Above all, never, ever disappear. Keep your social and conference and event calendars full. As an up-and-comer, you must work hard to remain visible and active among your ever-budding network of friends and contacts. — location: [1467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1467) ^ref-30677

---
It should be fun, not time-consuming. When your network is set, your goals written down, you’ll find plenty of hours during the day to do what needs to be done. — location: [1488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1488) ^ref-41944

I had two days, three people I wanted to see, and only one available time slot to see them all. How do you manage a situation like this? I “cloned” the dinner and invited all of them to join me. Each would benefit from knowing the others, and I’d be able to catch up with all of them and perhaps even get some creative input about the new TV show. — location: [1495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1495) ^ref-8388

---
The point is, I’m constantly looking to include others in whatever I’m doing. It’s good for them, good for me, and good for everyone to broaden their circle of friends. — location: [1501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1501) ^ref-23005

I highly recommend you budget some time and money for conferences, and to visit cities where you can schedule a few days or even just an overnight during which you host a cocktail party or schedule a bunch of meetings. — location: [1524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1524) ^ref-27911

Host a “virtual happy hour” once a month and organize it around a discussion — location: [1527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1527) ^ref-25995

Shared interests are the basic building blocks of any relationship. Race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or business, professional, and personal interests are relational glue. It makes sense, then, that events and activities where you’ll thrive are those built around interests you’re most passionate about. — location: [1557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1557) ^ref-28081

---
Yet surely, you have more than ten friends. It is what you do together that matters, not how often you meet. That’s why you have to pay special attention to where you’re most comfortable and what activities you most enjoy. — location: [1562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1562) ^ref-16972

---
Make a list of the things you’re most passionate about. Use your passions as a guide to which activities and events you should be seeking out. Use them to engage new and old contacts. If you love baseball, for example, take potential and current clients to a ball game, or invite them to join you in a fantasy league. It doesn’t matter what you do, only that it’s something you love doing. — location: [1600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1600) ^ref-44627

7. Volunteering. Work with an organization to create a day of service that can involve five to ten volunteers, or pull together a team to join a charity walk. — location: [1618](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1618) ^ref-53399

---
Do you want to stand out from the crowd? Then you’ll be miles ahead by following up better and smarter than the hordes scrambling for the person’s attention. The fact is, most people don’t follow up very well, if at all. Good follow-up alone elevates you above 95 percent of your peers. The follow-up is the hammer and nails of your networking tool kit. — location: [1640](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1640) ^ref-9333

---
When I leave the meeting, I put the name and e-mail address of the new acquaintance in my contact list and program my calendar to remind me in a month’s time to drop the person another e-mail, just to keep in touch. — location: [1653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1653) ^ref-39618

Don’t think of your next conference as a business-related retreat. Think of it as a well-coordinated campaign to further your mission. Here are the rules I follow at each and every event I attend: — location: [1718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1718) ^ref-8551

---
How do you find yourself part of the process? It’s not really all that hard. First, review the event’s materials, visit its website, and find out who the main contact is for putting together the conference. Put in a phone call. The person responsible for these kinds of events is generally overworked and stressed out. I like to call these people a few months ahead of the event and say, “I’m really looking forward to the conference you’re putting together. I’m interested in helping make this year be the best year ever, and I’m willing to devote a chunk of my resources—be it time, creativity, or connections—to make this year’s event a smash hit. How can I help?” — location: [1724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00H6JBFOS&location=1724) ^ref-16720
