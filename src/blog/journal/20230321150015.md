title: SaaS ideas as blog posts

If you create content regularly, you know that you can never predict what will resonate with people.

You've labored over pieces for hours or days that resulted in crickets.

You've tossed out a three sentence post while sitting at a red light that got higher than average engagement.

Remember: the same is true for SaaS products, or any other type of product.

No matter how skilled you are, or how brilliant your idea is, there's a meaningful portion of entrepreneurship that's a numbers game. There are a ton of variables at play that are both out of our control and unknown to us.

For most of us it takes 20+ attempts before we hit on something that makes waves.

You won't know what will resonate with people until you put it out there.

Embrace it.
Experiment.
Move on quickly.
Place many small bets.
