## Highlights
We call it value innovation because instead of focusing on beating the competition, you focus on making the competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for buyers and your company, thereby opening up new and uncontested market space. — location: [416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=416) ^ref-19039

---
Value innovation places equal emphasis on value and innovation. — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=417) ^ref-39940

Cirque strategically priced its tickets against those of the theater, lifting the price point of the circus industry by several multiples while still pricing its productions to capture the mass of adult customers, who were used to theater prices. — location: [469](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=469) ^ref-56453

buyers. Cost savings are made by eliminating and reducing the factors an industry competes on. Buyer value is lifted by raising and creating elements the industry has never offered. Over time, costs are reduced further as scale economies kick in due to the high sales volumes that superior value generates. — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=474) ^ref-46438

---
As shown in figure 1-2, the creation of blue oceans is about driving costs down while simultaneously driving value up for buyers. — location: [478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=478) ^ref-64108

Effective blue ocean strategy should be about risk minimization and not risk taking. — location: [578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=578) ^ref-34460

---
It is by pursuing the first two questions (of eliminating and reducing) that you gain insight into how to drop your cost structure vis-à-vis competitors. — location: [663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=663) ^ref-18232

---
The second two factors, by contrast, provide you with insight into how to lift buyer value and create new demand. — location: [665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=665) ^ref-8353

low. Of particular importance are the actions of eliminating and creating, which push companies to go beyond value maximization exercises with existing factors of competition. — location: [667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=667) ^ref-4113

Every great strategy has focus, and a company’s strategic profile, or value curve, should clearly show it. Looking at Southwest’s profile, we can see at once that the company emphasizes only three factors: friendly service, speed, and frequent point-to-point departures. — location: [772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=772) ^ref-18042

---
In fact, a good way to test the effectiveness and strength of a strategy is to look at whether it contains a strong and authentic tagline. — location: [791](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=791) ^ref-7019

Trade journals, trade shows, and consumer rating reports reinforce the vertical walls between one industry and another. Often, however, the space between alternative industries provides opportunities for value innovation. — location: [884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=884) ^ref-13336

---
What are the alternative industries to your industry? Why do customers trade across them? By focusing on the key factors that lead buyers to trade across alternative industries and eliminating or reducing everything else, you can create a blue ocean of new market space. — location: [962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=962) ^ref-14782

---
What are the strategic groups in your industry? Why do customers trade up for the higher group, and why do they trade down for the lower one? — location: [1035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1035) ^ref-64988

---
What is the chain of buyers in your industry? Which buyer group does your industry typically focus on? If you shifted the buyer group of your industry, how could you unlock new value?5 — location: [1096](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1096) ^ref-48011

What is the context in which your product or service is used? What happens before, during, and after? Can you identify the pain points? How can you eliminate these pain points through a complementary product or service offering? — location: [1155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1155) ^ref-14980

---
There were far more noncustomers than customers. — location: [1195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1195) ^ref-39543

---
For the purpose of the exercise, settlers are defined as me-too businesses, migrators are business offerings better than most in the marketplace, and pioneers are your value innovation offerings. — location: [1529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1529) ^ref-2812

---
Chief executives should instead use value and innovation as the important parameters for managing their portfolio of businesses. They should use innovation because, without it, companies are stuck in the trap of competitive improvements. They should use value because innovative ideas will be profitable only if they are linked to what buyers are willing to pay for. — location: [1540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1540) ^ref-19534

---
To maximize the size of their blue oceans, companies need to take a reverse course. Instead of concentrating on customers, they need to look to noncustomers. And instead of focusing on customer differences, they need to build on powerful commonalities in what buyers value. That allows companies to reach beyond existing demand to unlock a new mass of customers that did not exist before. — location: [1579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1579) ^ref-22979

---
Where is your locus of attention—on capturing a greater share of existing customers, or on converting noncustomers of the industry into new demand? Do you seek out key commonalities in what buyers value, or do you strive to embrace customer differences through finer customization and segmentation? To reach beyond existing demand, think noncustomers before customers; commonalities before differences; and desegmentation before pursuing finer segmentation. — location: [1595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1595) ^ref-14832

---
There are three tiers of noncustomers that can be transformed into customers. — location: [1601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1601) ^ref-34349

market. They are buyers who minimally purchase an industry’s offering out of necessity but are mentally noncustomers of the industry. They are waiting to jump ship and leave the industry as soon as the opportunity presents itself. — location: [1603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1603) ^ref-59494

---
The lesson: noncustomers tend to offer far more insight into how to unlock and grow a blue ocean than do relatively content existing customers. — location: [1644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1644) ^ref-46982

---
What are the key reasons first-tier noncustomers want to jump ship and leave your industry? Look for the commonalities across their responses. Focus on these, and not on the differences between them. — location: [1648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1648) ^ref-21569

---
The third tier of noncustomers is the farthest away from an industry’s existing customers. Typically, these unexplored noncustomers have not been targeted or thought of as potential customers by any player in the industry. That’s because their needs and the business opportunities associated with them have somehow always been assumed to belong to other markets. — location: [1689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1689) ^ref-553

---
There is no hard-and-fast rule to suggest which tier of noncustomers you should focus on and when. Because the scale of blue ocean opportunities that a specific tier of noncustomers can unlock varies across time and industries, you should focus on the tier that represents the biggest catchment that your organization has the capability to act on. But you should also explore whether there are overlapping commonalities across all three tiers of noncustomers. In that way, you can expand the scope of latent demand you can unleash. When that is the case, you should not focus on a specific tier but instead should look across tiers. The rule here is to go for the largest catchment that your organization has competence to seize. — location: [1745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1745) ^ref-9999

The technology trap that snagged Philips and Motorola trips up the best and brightest companies time and again. Unless the technology makes buyers’ lives dramatically simpler, more convenient, more productive, less risky, or more fun and fashionable, it will not attract the masses no matter how many awards it wins. Value innovation is not the same as technology innovation. — location: [1802](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1802) ^ref-53594

---
It is increasingly important, however, to know from the start what price will quickly capture the mass of target buyers. — location: [1856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1856) ^ref-55766

---
There are two reasons for this change. First, companies are discovering that volume generates higher returns than it used to. As the nature of goods becomes more knowledge intensive, companies bear much more of their costs in product development than in manufacturing. This is easy to understand in the software industry. While producing Apple’s iOS software, for example, cost Apple billions, once produced it could be installed in an infinite number of computers for a nearly trivial cost to Apple. This makes volume key. — location: [1856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1856) ^ref-14234

---
All this means that the strategic price you set for your offering must not only attract buyers in large numbers but also help you to retain them. Given the high potential for free riding, an offering’s reputation must be earned on day one, because brand building increasingly relies heavily on word-of-mouth recommendations spreading rapidly through our networked society. Companies must therefore start with an offer that buyers can’t refuse and must keep it that way to discourage any free-riding imitations. This is what makes strategic pricing key. Strategic pricing addresses this question: Is your offering priced to attract the mass of target buyers from the start so that they have a compelling ability to pay for it? When exceptional utility is combined with strategic pricing, imitation is discouraged. — location: [1880](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1880) ^ref-22632

---
Many companies that create blue oceans attract customers from other industries who use a product or service that performs the same function or bears the same core utility as the new one but takes a very different physical form. — location: [1897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1897) ^ref-16052

car. The key here is not to pursue pricing against the competition within an industry but rather to pursue pricing against substitutes and alternatives across industries and nonindustries. — location: [1917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1917) ^ref-47258

---
The second part of the tool helps managers determine how high a price they can afford to set within the corridor without inviting competition from imitation products or services. — location: [1921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1921) ^ref-4840

---
On the other hand, companies with uncertain patent and asset protection should consider pricing somewhere in the middle of the corridor. As for companies that have no such protection, lower-boundary strategic pricing is advised. — location: [1929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1929) ^ref-39742

---
To maximize the profit potential of a blue ocean idea, a company should start with the strategic price and then deduct its desired profit margin from the price to arrive at the target cost. — location: [1940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1940) ^ref-24180

---
Here, price-minus costing, and not cost-plus pricing, is essential if you are to arrive at a cost structure that is both profitable and hard for potential followers to match. — location: [1941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=1941) ^ref-38910

---
To hit the cost target that supports that profit, companies have two key levers: one is streamlining and cost innovations, and the other is partnering. — location: [2002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=2002) ^ref-54073

---
When a company’s offering successfully addresses the profit side of the business model, the company is ready to advance to the final step in the sequence of blue ocean strategy. FIGURE 6-6 — location: [2005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=2005) ^ref-2434

Although companies should build their blue ocean strategy in the sequence of utility, price, cost, and adoption, these criteria form an integral whole to ensure commercial success. — location: [2056](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=2056) ^ref-34300

Blue ocean strategy is not about being first to market. Rather it’s about being first to get it right by linking innovation to value. One need only look to Apple here. The iMac wasn’t the first PC, the iPod wasn’t the first MP3 player, iTunes wasn’t the first digital music store, and the iPhone certainly wasn’t the first smart phone, nor for that matter was the iPad the first smart tablet. But what they all successfully did was link innovation to value. — location: [3060](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=3060) ^ref-44646

structure. Blue ocean strategy, by contrast, is about breaking the value-cost trade-off to open up new market space. It is about pursuing differentiation and low cost simultaneously. — location: [3070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=3070) ^ref-28898

---
Instead of focusing on low cost per se, it seeks to create a leap in buyer value at a lower cost. — location: [3080](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=3080) ^ref-28579

---
The key here is not to pursue pricing against the competition within an industry but to pursue pricing against substitutes and alternatives that are currently capturing the noncustomers of your industry. — location: [3081](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=3081) ^ref-2990

---
Value innovation, not innovation per se, is the singular focus of blue ocean strategy. — location: [3100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=3100) ^ref-34804

---
Blue ocean strategy should also not be confused with a niche strategy. While the field of marketing has placed significant emphasis on finer segmentation to effectively capture niche markets, blue ocean strategy works in the reverse direction. It is more about desegmenting markets by focusing on key commonalities across buyer groups to open up and capture the largest catchment of demand. When practitioners confuse the two, they all too often are driven to look for customer differences for niche markets in the existing industry space rather than the commonalities that cut across buyer groups in search of blue oceans of new demand. — location: [3114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00O4CRR7Y&location=3114) ^ref-63118
