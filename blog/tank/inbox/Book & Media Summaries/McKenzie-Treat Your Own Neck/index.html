<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>Muscles, which are the source of power and cause movement, can be overstretched but usually heal rapidly and seldom cause pain lasting for more than a week or two. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00UM2O5RU&amp;location=290">290</a> ^ref-35262</p>

<p>If you reduce the lordosis for long periods at a time and never properly restore it, you eventually lose the ability to form the hollow. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00UM2O5RU&amp;location=348">348</a> ^ref-600</p>
<hr>
<p>When we sit and relax in a chair (Photo 11), the head and neck slowly protrude because the muscles that support them become tired. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00UM2O5RU&amp;location=356">356</a> ^ref-49547</p>
<hr>
<p>When the protruded head posture is maintained long enough, it causes overstretching of ligaments. Thus pain will arise only in certain positions. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00UM2O5RU&amp;location=364">364</a> ^ref-44938</p>

<p>To sit comfortably and correctly you must hold your head just short of the extreme retracted posture. To find this position you must first retract the head as far as possible (Photo 23) and then release the last ten percent of this movement (Photo 24). Now you have reached the correct head and neck posture, which can be maintained for any length of time. It may take up to eight days of practise to master this. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00UM2O5RU&amp;location=429">429</a> ^ref-22175</p>

<p>When sitting for prolonged periods - sit correctly, with the low back supported by a lumbar roll and the head retracted. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00UM2O5RU&amp;location=446">446</a> ^ref-2583</p>
<hr>
<p>When sitting for prolonged periods, regular interruption of prolonged neck bending is essential. This can be achieved by retracting the head and extending the neck five or six times at regular intervals, for example each hour. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00UM2O5RU&amp;location=453">453</a> ^ref-46026</p>
<hr>
<p>After vigorous activity, retract the head and extend the neck five or six times. If you sit down to rest, avoid the protruded head posture. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00UM2O5RU&amp;location=503">503</a> ^ref-751</p>
