<p>The Origins of Time
Time is not what you think it is</p>
<p>What is time? Does it even exist? When did it start, and when will it end?</p>
<p>Looking into the future, it feels like there's no option but for it to continue on infinitely, while looking into the past, it only makes sense that it had a beginning. A similar thing happens when we think about the creation of the universe - it's hard to imagine the universe having existed infinitely into the past, yet we can't imagine it disappearing in the future. If it does, what will be left behind?</p>
<p>Let's start by looking at the definition of time.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, time is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the continued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence" title="Sequence">sequence</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence" title="Existence">existence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(philosophy)" title="Event (philosophy)">events</a> that occurs in an apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_process" title="Irreversible process">irreversible</a> succession from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past" title="Past">past</a>, through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present" title="Present">present</a>, into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future" title="Future">future</a>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is more or less how most of us would have described time, or at least this will ring true to us. Expanding on this, most people's perception of time, is that it's linear, and a single variable common across the entire universe.</p>
<p>As we're about to see, this isn't true. Our notion of time works in our limited view of the world, and in the limited geography we inhabit, but not on a large scale, and if we truly want to understand time, it's meaning and it's consequences, we need to look both at the universe both at a macro and micro level.</p>
<p>The work of Carlo Rovello-an Italian theoretical physicist, who's focus is on quantum gravity -goes a long way in helping us wrap our heads around what time is, and its origins.</p>
<p>We think of time a sequence of events occuring along a linear axis of time, common to the universe as a whole. We wonder what people across the world are doing at this moment, and what's happening on Mars right now, or in far away galaxies. Yet, this notion of time, as something the universe has in common, is dispelled, not with ideas or theories, but with facts that simultaneously can make us feel like we have a better understanding of how the world works, yet make it look ever more complex.</p>
<p>Through the lens of a physicist, our notion of time, and how we think about it, is all wrong.</p>
<p>There are four facts that break down this view of time:</p>
<ol>
<li>You may have heard that astronauts that have been to space come back slightly younger than someone born at the same moment as them but never left earth. This is because time progresses at different speeds depending on it's position in the universe. The higher the graviational force, the slower time moves.
We now have clocks good enough to notice the difference in time as close as 32 inches apart. In other words, given two watches of this quality, if I held one over my head and put one in my pocket, there would be a registered difference in time in a relatively short period of time. Obviously this affect is small on earth, and serves our purposes just fine, but at a larger scale completely break down our perception of what time is and how it works.</li>
</ol>
<p>On a large scale, if one were to be able to travel near a black hole for a few hours, and come back to earth, they'd discover that hundreds off years o nearth had passed in that couple of years near the black hole. Time travel, anyone?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Time between two clock is affected by how they move. Similar to time slowing as gravity increases, time also slows as velocity increases. The closer you get to the speed of light, the more time slows to a crawl.
So while time is in one sense speeding up for that astronaut traveling away from earth, once in orbit, they are zooming around at high enough speeds to slow time back down. In the end, veloicty wins in this case, and the astronaut will come back to earth some milliseconds younger than his counterpart that never left earth.</li>
</ol>
<p>The consequence of this, is that it's impossible to say the time between any two given points. Armed with the understanding, of time being affected by both location and velocity, we see that time is a local notion. Time can be local to a particular point is space, as well as to a given object with respect to it's location and movement. Therefore, a single time variable no longer makes sense. Time is on a different trajectory for every object and every location in the universe.
If you did decide to travel to that black hole, there would be no way for you to set a common meeting time with somebody still on earth.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Laws of physics have a hard time distinguishing past from future. Whatever can happen in one direction can happen in the other. But in our world there is a difference in past vs future. So where is the difference? How can we differentiate, with physics the past from the future?
Turns out the one prinicipal that helps is heat and temperature, as defined by the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy, or, the gradual transition from order to disorder, only grows. Entropy does not decrease.
Let's look at an example. If you look at a video of a pendulum played forwards and backwards, you won't be able to tell the difference. It isn't until the objects gradually slows down that it will be visibily obvious which video represents the actual sequence of events, versus the reverse.  If you tie an object to string, and let it swing, eventually it will slow, due to friction, or heat. And this is the defining ingredient for differentiating between past and future.</li>
</ol>
<p>At a micro level, it's the ordered motion of molecules moving, in turn causing the surrounding molecules to become less orderly. This is the only thing that distinguishes past from future - that things were ordered and caused disorder. Who ordered them? We don't know.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Structure of time is governed by gravity. Gravity slows down time.
Quantum mechanics implies small fluctuations in time and space. So the idea of a single time variable doesn't work anymore.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can now see that time is very relative. Similarly, and more obviously,
the concept of up and down are uncontroversial, yet there is no up and down in the universe. If I'm standing in Paris, we can all agree that toward the sky is up, and towards out feet is down. But it's the opposite in Australia. It's not that the notions of up and down are wrong, it's just that it's relative. The universe does not have an up or a down.</p>
<p>If we move further, and think about the world without time, we tend to think of things as &quot;frozen&quot; in time. But this is not the case, rather, it's the opposite. Events occur, but not in time. No object or location exists on a synced time scale. We can have multiple clocks that have different times.
&quot;There is no preferred time all over the universe.&quot;</p>
<p>The consequence of this then, is that on a grand scale, we cannot identify events happening at the same time. This concept doesn't exist. And beyond this, everything we see, think, and comprehend is something from the past. This is easiest understood what we think about looking at the moon, the distance for which light takes about 1.3 seconds to travel. By the time we see it, we're seeing it in the past.</p>
<p>We should not think of the world as a set of objects, but rather we should think of the world as a sequence of events happening with respect to one another.</p>
<p>Where does this idea of time come from?</p>
<p>&quot;The difference between the past and the future has to do with the way we interact with the world. It's not just in the world, it's in the perspective between us and the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of what we think about te world, is just in our perspective. Stars moving at night, sun rising. The universe isn't turning, we are.</p>
<p>The same happens in time.</p>
<p>&quot;Time isn't the clock the goes around, it's exactly the memories of the past.&quot;</p>
<p>We can remember the past and intuit the future.</p>
<p>Music only exists because we can remember what came before any given note. Additionally we can anticipate what's coming. At any given moment we're only hearing one note or moment of silence, which we are not likely to find moves us emotionally on its own. It's out ability to recall what happened in the past and carry it forward as a memory that makes music have the effect on us that it does. This occurs in our brain, and has nothing to do with physics. Music is not something that exists outside of our heads.</p>
<p>Time is not a neutral notion for us. Time is our identity. But also our good and bad emotions of ourselves. We suffer because we lose things. The emotional component is largely what we're talking about when we talk about time. Time is what takes away everything to us. So let's not forget about it, or ignore it, but take the time to understand what it is outside of our perceptions to better understand and appreciate this universe.</p>
