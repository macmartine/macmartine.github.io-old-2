It starts with benchmarking   You’ll find it difficult to pluck this out of the air, so to assist I’ve mapped out the four core data points you should be taking notice of, you should look to benchmark how you fare (take data from the previous few months) in order that we clearly know our starting point.   1. Getting attention If nobody reaches your site, or even knows your name you may be facing obstacles getting attention, what specifically is stopping you getting the attention you need?   Example response:  I currently attract 500 visits per month to my site / portfolio   2. Converting attention to leads Whether you’re working online or offline, the need to build leads is insatiable.  How can you get the volume of leads (enquiries / briefs / inbound calls) you need to support the growth you need?   Example response:  I currently convert 2% of these visits into leads (10 leads)   3. Converting leads to customers Whether this is improving your sales process, strengthening your lead nurturing or upping your conversion rate you will have obstacles in this area if you aren’t hitting the numbers.   Example response:  Of every five leads I win one new client – I have a 20% lead to customer rate (2 customers)   4. Managing a steadily increasing average order value Put simply, you have the ability to re-engineer the way you look at pricing (which we look at in Phase II) so you should map out what your benchmark number is, in order that we can make an impact on it.   Example response:  My average project fee is about $2,000 — location: [588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJIDO9C&location=588) ^ref-18077

Could you improve each by just 20%?   Here is the interesting thing; to increase your earnings by 100% you only need to improve in each of the four areas by 20%. — location: [606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJIDO9C&location=606) ^ref-63749

Teresa Amabile is a Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School.  In 2011, following years of research and on-the-ground experiments she released her watershed book, The Progress Principle.   In it, she outlined that incremental progress against defined goals was a key psychological trigger for maximizing motivation. — location: [815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJIDO9C&location=815) ^ref-462

Brand touchpoints A brand is not ‘a logo’, nor is it even strictly ‘design’.  A brand is an experience, a feeling, a sense and a vibration that oozes out of every interaction (however fleeting) between your business and a prospective client. Tangible mechanisms like a logo, a name, design, website content, proposal documents and others, are the vehicles that create that intangible experience.   It’s vital that every touchpoint works in your favor. Each one must tell your story, attract the interest of dream clients, and communicate efficiently with current clients. — location: [992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJIDO9C&location=992) ^ref-61735

The product will essentially remain the same. But you need to describe the experiential outcome. You need to crank up the contrast between the client’s life with you as their service provider, and life without you. — location: [1038](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJIDO9C&location=1038) ^ref-15359

“The thing is, in school we’re taught that writing is hard, but it isn’t. You just need to write like you talk,” he said, and I hung on for how he’d continue.   “So rather than sitting down trying to write for a built-up, abstract idea of an ideal prospect, imagine it’s a person and you’re sitting across from them, just talking. Call them ‘Sam’, to make it personal.”   “What are you going to say verbally to Sam, given what he’s currently thinking?   Then what are you going to follow that up with to get him to stick around?” — location: [1051](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJIDO9C&location=1051) ^ref-32095

In those 88 words, he articulated what it generally takes me an hour to hammer home: that ultimately, clients come to you hoping to solve a problem they have. Nothing more, nothing less. Your skills – they expect – are the vehicle for getting from their current situation to where they want to be. But it isn’t the skills they really care about. — location: [1061](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00PJIDO9C&location=1061) ^ref-13959
