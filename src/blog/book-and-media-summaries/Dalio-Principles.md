## Highlights
I believe that the key to success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well. By failing well, I mean being able to experience painful failures that provide big learnings without failing badly enough to get knocked out of the game. — location: [113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=113) ^ref-61661

---
To be a successful entrepreneur, the same is true: One also has to be an independent thinker who correctly bets against the consensus, which means being painfully wrong a fair amount. — location: [120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=120) ^ref-37241

---
I also feared boredom and mediocrity much more than I feared failure. For me, great is better than terrible, and terrible is better than mediocre, because terrible at least gives life flavor. — location: [261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=261) ^ref-56949

I gradually learned that prices reflect people’s expectations, so they go up when actual results are better than expected and they go down when they are worse than expected. And most people tend to be biased by their recent experiences. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=275) ^ref-27862

Learning to meditate helped too. When the Beatles visited India in 1968 to study Transcendental Meditation at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, I was curious to learn it, so I did. I loved it. Meditation has benefited me hugely throughout my life because it produces a calm open-mindedness — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=279) ^ref-46166

Think about it: It’s senseless to have making money as your goal as money has no intrinsic value—its value comes from what it can buy, and it can’t buy everything. It’s smarter to start with what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them. Money will be one of the things you need, but it’s not the only one and certainly not the most important one once you get past having the amount you need to get what you really want. — location: [450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=450) ^ref-5036

---
So, for me, meaningful work and meaningful relationships were and still are my primary goals and everything I did was for them. Making money was an incidental consequence of that. — location: [458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=458) ^ref-40930

And I saw clearly that the best way to answer this question is by finding other independent thinkers who are on the same mission as me and who see things differently from me. — location: [620](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=620) ^ref-15841

---
In other words, I just want to be right—I don’t care if the right answer comes from me. So I learned to be radically open-minded to allow others to point out what I might be missing. — location: [622](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=622) ^ref-50386

Typically, by doing what comes naturally to us, we fail to account for our weaknesses, which leads us to crash. — location: [634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=634) ^ref-28297

---
I saw that to do exceptionally well you have to push your limits and that, if you push your limits, you will crash and it will hurt a lot. You will think you have failed—but that won’t be true unless you give up. — location: [641](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=641) ^ref-10375

But I needed to have both low risk and high returns, and by setting out on a mission to discover how I could, I learned to go slowly when faced with the choice between two things that you need that are seemingly at odds. That way you can figure out how to have as much of both as possible. There is almost always a good path that you just haven’t discovered yet, so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent to you. — location: [647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=647) ^ref-25292
