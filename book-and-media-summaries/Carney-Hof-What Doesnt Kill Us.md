## Highlights
The struggles of us privileged denizens of the developed world—getting a job, funding a retirement, getting kids into a good school, posting the exactly right social media update—pale in comparison to the daily threats of death or deprivation that our ancestors faced. — location: [184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=184) ^ref-16115

Human biology needs stress—not the sort of stress that damages muscle, gets us eaten by a bear, or degrades our physiques—but the sort of environmental and physical oscillations that invigorates our nervous systems. — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=193) ^ref-47216

Human biology needs stress—not the sort of stress that damages muscle, gets us eaten by a bear, or degrades our physiques—but the sort of environmental and physical oscillations that invigorates our nervous systems. We’ve been honed over millennia to adapt to an ever-changing environment. Those fluctuations are ingrained in our physiology in countless ways that are, for the most part, unconnected to our conscious minds. — location: [193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=193) ^ref-5259

example, a plunge into ice-cold water not only triggers a number of processes to warm the body, but also tweaks insulin production, tightens the circulatory system, and heightens mental awareness. — location: [199](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=199) ^ref-20256

Once you arrive at high altitude, your body automatically produces more red blood cells to compensate for lower oxygen saturation. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=228) ^ref-1561

Move to an oppressively hot environment and your body will sweat out fewer salts over time and produce lower volumes of urine. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=229) ^ref-6011

Heat will also stimulate your cardiovascular system to become more efficient and increase evaporation and cooling. Yet no environmental extreme induces as many changes in human physiology as the cold does. — location: [230](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=230) ^ref-32547

Arteries carry red, oxygen-rich blood away from the heart and lungs while blue-tinged veins carry it back. — location: [240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=240) ^ref-12524

There are also muscles that we have almost no control over whatsoever. These include muscles that control the pace of the heart, the motion of the vascular system, the speed of digestion, and the dilation of our pupils. All of these are part of the autonomic nervous system—the body’s version of autopilot. But there’s a third group of muscles and reactions that are shared between the autonomic and somatic systems. — location: [263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=263) ^ref-37587

---
There has never been evolutionary pressure to put the circulatory system under conscious control, so the response to cold, for example, has been uniform throughout much of our evolution: Preserve the core at the expense of the extremities. No thought needed. — location: [274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=274) ^ref-30370

Without external signals and inputs that were designed by evolution over millennia, our bodies are simply not being called upon to perform what have always been critical functions. — location: [279](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=279) ^ref-40123

The breathing technique emerged naturally. He started by mimicking the rapid breaths people take instinctively when they plunge into icy water, which he says are similar to the breaths a woman takes during childbirth. — location: [431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=431) ^ref-45032

Researchers at Maastricht University in the Netherlands wondered if Hof’s abilities stemmed from a high concentration of mitochondria-rich brown adipose tissue, also known as brown fat. — location: [572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=572) ^ref-26488

system. In 2011, Hof met Pickkers and mentioned that he could suppress or ramp up his immune system at will—a feat that is, by definition, almost impossible. But Pickkers, who had watched Hof’s career rise on TV, was curious. — location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=602) ^ref-49245

During vasoconstriction the limbs get much colder than the core. When the body starts to warm up, it lets blood through the vascular system again. Blood chills as it passes through the cold arms, hands, and feet, and when it eventually circulates back to the heart it lowers the body’s overall core temperature. — location: [655](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IIQQF2O&location=655) ^ref-45055
