<p>People:</p>
<p>Lucrisious</p>
<p>Democratis</p>
<p>Plato and Aristotle disagreed with physicists, they thought everything happened with a purpose. The earth is round? Well then why does it benefit by being round?</p>
<p>Lucricious, as a pupil of a pupil of Democratis, brought back the ideas of Democratis later.</p>
<p>The writings of Democratis were destroyed, likely because the church didn't like his ideas because they didn't rely on the existence of gods. The church banned the readings of Lucricious.</p>
<p>These ideas differed dramatically from the existing views of the world as said by Dante. That's the world was hierarchical, as was the organization of European society. Dante's world was finalistic, fear of god, fear of death. No consideration for nature.</p>
<p>Pythagorus said that math/number had great utility. Plato took that further and taught the world that mathematics could play a huge role in understanding the world</p>
<p>Copernicus determined celestial bodies revolve along the sun not the earth. Based on math, not the idea that we are simply at the center of the universe.  how in the year 1641st time time of Alexandra and figured out how to do something better. Clearly there is a long gap in science then.</p>
<p>Then go away I'll get sent a telescope and confirm all the Copernicus's  ideas.</p>
<p>Galileo then determined that if objects in the sky move in a predictable pattern via mathematics, things on earth must do the same. So he set out to prove that.</p>
<p>Experimental science begins with Galileo. As he drops the ball it measures and speaks to earth.</p>
<p>whereas for Aristotle things were just following their natural movement.</p>
<p>What  he found was that the rate of falling was not constant as people thought, but accelerated at the beginning and the rate of acceleration is constant. This acceleration is the same for all objects.</p>
<p>Newton then determined that the same force that causes moons to orbit planets must be the same as the force that cause objects to fall on earth.</p>
<p>Every body attracts every other body.</p>
<p>There's no longer a separation between Heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Newtons constant = g = gravity</p>
<p>The world of Newton is the world of Democritus rendered mathematical.</p>
<p>Newton lead the way to modern science.</p>
<p>He knew there were more forces and work and someone else discovered electromagnetism, which holds together atoms into a mass. And creates friction and allows for electricity.</p>
<p>And the concept of an electromagnetic field begin to explain how this an objects can push and pull on each other.</p>
<p>And the concept of an electromagnetic field begin to explain how this an objects can push and pull on each other.</p>
<p>Einstein took this discovery and combined it with newtons law of gravity.</p>
<p>Farraday  lines are lines of force. Push and pull between objects. This led to the discovery of what light is which is oscillating faraday lines.</p>
<p>Einstein's special relativity:</p>
<p>Einstein determined that space and time go hand-in-hand to form space time and electricity and magnetism do the same to form the electromagnetic field. Same with energy and mass. In each case they are two facets of the same thing.</p>
<p>Mass can become energy and vice versa but they cannot exist independently.</p>
<p>I’Einstein's general relativity:</p>
<p>Role is negative feelings in progress p.m. There's no need to add space.</p>
<p>Space is simply the gravitational field.</p>
<p>The gravitational field moves as do faraday lines and light.</p>
<p>space is now no different than matter what is a real entity.</p>
<p>Space bends around masses, as does light.</p>
<p>Time warps and bends.  it is slower in lower altitudes and faster in higher altitudes.</p>
<p>So, masses distorts space-time</p>
<p>Einstein came up with the idea of a 3 sphere to explain the universe as finite but with no boundaries. Think of the surface of the earth… can walk around it and end up where you started. It's finite but with no boundaries.</p>
<p>Einstein thought the universe was fixed and finite but his equations told him otherwise. He didn't believe them. But because everything attracts, the only way for a finite universe not to collapse on itself is for it to be expanding. Just as a football is either rising due to being kicked, or falling. But it cannot just rest in mid air.</p>
<p>Max Plank: figured out energy comes in measurable packets - photons. Photos are grains of light - quanta.</p>
<p>First building block of quantum mechanics:</p>
<p>There is a fundamental granularity in all things including light.</p>
<p>Bohr's atomic model:</p>
<p>As photos come in packets, Bohr discovered electronics orbit the nuclei in atoms at specific frequencies only, and the frequency of the orbit defines the frequency (color) of light emitted.</p>
<p>Second building block: The relational aspect of things:</p>
<p>Electrons don't always exist. They exist when they are interacting with something else. They materialize when they collide with something else. Electrons are a combination of leaps from one interaction to another. When nothing disturbed it it does not exist in any place.</p>
<p>Third building block: indeterminacy:</p>
<p>We can't predict the future as Einstein thought, but we can predict with probability of where an electron will appear. Change operates at the atomic level.</p>
<p>We now combine the discoveries above and see that fields and particles are the same. Peels are made up of granular particles. Light is made up of granular photons. There are other types of fields who's quanta I'll behave the same (?).  there are approximately 15 fields who is quanta are the elementary particles.</p>
<p>Dark matter however does not follow the same model. We do not yet understand it.</p>
<p>With quantum mechanics today the world is no longer made up of fields and particles, But of a single type of entity: a quantum field, whose elementary events happen in space-time</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics tells us there's a limit to information and a limit to the number of states the system can be in. Therefore, knowledge is finite.</p>
<p>The movement of particles is random, but they balance out overtime, average out, so to our eye things look stable and predictable. However if we were to look closely at a rock we would see swarming moving particles.</p>
<p>Relative relativity: properties are only existent with respect to another object. The earth is only moving in relation to another object not on its own. Einstein extended the idea of relativity to time. quantum mechanics extends this further. all variable aspects of a given object only change in relation to another object. It is only in interactions that nature draws the world. in quantum mechanics there is no reality except in the relations between physical systems. relations ground the notion of thanks. It is not a world of objects it is a world of events.</p>
<p>Summary: quantum mechanics is the discovery of three features of the world: granularity: the information of the system is finite and limited by Planck's constant.</p>
<p>Indeterminacy: events we see are statistical not determined by the past</p>
<p>Relationality: events of the world are always interactions. All events occur in relation to another system.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics teaches us to not think of the world in terms of things, but of processes which lead from one interaction to another.</p>
