## Highlights
All that angry, whiny, petty stuff that you write down in the morning stands between you and your creativity. Worrying about the job, the laundry, the funny knock in the car, the weird look in your lover’s eye—this stuff eddies through our subconscious and muddies our days. Get it on the page. — location: [473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=473) ^ref-21343

A mind too active is no mind at all. — location: [491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=491) ^ref-21632

Morning pages are nonnegotiable. Never skip or skimp on morning pages. Your mood doesn’t matter. The rotten thing your Censor says doesn’t matter. We have this idea that we need to be in the mood to write. We don — location: [497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=497) ^ref-20392

Management consultants, in pursuit of corporate physical health, have learned to think of meditation primarily as a stress-management technique. Spiritual seekers choose to view the process as a gateway to God. Artists and creativity mavens approve of it as a conduit for higher creative insights. — location: [538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=538) ^ref-38700

We meditate to discover our own identity, our right place in the scheme of the universe. Through meditation, we acquire and eventually acknowledge our connection to an inner power source that has the ability to transform our outer world. In other words, meditation gives us not only the light of insight but also the power for expansive change. — location: [544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=544) ^ref-3779

It is impossible to write morning pages for any extended period of time without coming into contact with an unexpected inner power. Although I used them for many years before I realized this, the pages are a pathway to a strong and clear sense of self . They are a trail that we follow into our own interior, where we meet both our own creativity and our creator. — location: [549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=549) ^ref-21458

In filling the well, think magic. Think delight. Think fun. Do not think duty. Do not do what you should do—spiritual sit-ups like reading a dull but recommended critical text. Do what intrigues you, explore what interests you; think mystery, not mastery. — location: [698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=698) ^ref-8785

In filling the well, follow your sense of the mysterious, not your sense of what you should know more about. A mystery can be very simple: if I drive this road, not my usual road, what will I see? Changing a known route throws us into the now. We become refocused on the visible, visual world. Sight leads to insight. — location: [701](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=701) ^ref-64517

Showering, swimming, scrubbing, shaving, steering a car—so many s-like-yes words!—all of these are regular, repetitive activities that may tip us over from our logic brain into our more creative artist brain. — location: [720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=720) ^ref-25637

Intended fiction writers often go into newspapering or advertising, where they can use their gift without taking the plunge into their dreamed-of fiction-writing career. — location: [796](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=796) ^ref-38321

There will be many times when we won’t look good—to ourselves or anyone else. We need to stop demanding that we do. It is impossible to get better and look good at the same time. — location: [836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=836) ^ref-52412

When I make this point in teaching, I am met by instant, defensive hostility: “But do you know how old I will be by the time I learn to really play the piano/act/paint/write a decent play?” Yes ... the same age you will be if you don’t. So let’s start. — location: [842](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=842) ^ref-8392

Objections will start to pop up like burnt toast. These are your blurts. — location: [921](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B006H19H3M&location=921) ^ref-47834
