Jumping to a solution before we know the right problem is how we put out fires, not prevent them

The first problem we encounter is often not the right problem. This is why we shouldn't jump to solutions without considering if the problem has been defined properly.

How we state the problem dictates the solutions we see.

Top performers are often impatient b/c them jump into solution mode. 

2 ways to increase the odds we're solving the right problem.

1) Never accept someone else's definition of the problem.
2) Put of a firewall btw the problem definition and problem solution discussions. 2 separate meetings (when team-based).

Slow down, delay.

If personal (no team), articulate the problem in words or writing - make it concrete.

My takeaway here: In the context of fixing bugs, choose the correct solution, the one that will create less problems and easier decisions in the future.

Ask yourself:
- What would have to be true for this problem not to exist in the first place?
- Is this the symptom or the problem?
- Is this the root problem, or a secondary problem that the root problem has created?
- Will solving this particular problem pass the test of time?

At a high level, a decision involves:
- Solving a problem
- Preventing a future problem
- Capitalizing on an opportunity

Problem statement:
- What we want
- Where we want to go
- What's getting in the way of being there

So:
1) Get to the root problem
2) Ensure solution is addressing the cause of the problem, not a symptom of it

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure

It's easier to avoid problems than solve them

A lot of our time is spent correcting initial mistakes

Don't reward heroic fire-fighting. They should have prevented it in the first place. The root problem is that that problem shouldn't have occurred in the first place.

---

By separating the problem from the solution, you're giving yourself time to think, to process, to make connections, to see the big picture, to let your subconcious brain kick in. Getting yourself out of the short time-bursts of energy used to make decisions. Delaying intuition, and will as a result, make better decisions.

Real-world examples:

What problem, if addressed, would get Alex paying me on time?
- Demand letter, in time.
	- Does stand the test of time, at least as much as is possible, I think

What problem, if addressed,  would solve my Portugal salary issue?
- Dropping salary to $3300/mo would extend runway
- Or, get more money in the business account (but I believe it needs to be earned - can't pay out more than we make, can we?)
