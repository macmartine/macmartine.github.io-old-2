<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>let’s start by defining a Grand Slam Offer. It’s an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers . . . forever removing the cash constraint on business growth. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=429">429</a> ^ref-1573</p>
<hr>
<p>Your Grand Slam Offer, however, forces a prospect to stop and think differently to assess the value of your differentiated product. Doing this establishes you as your own category, which means it’s too difficult to compare prices, which means you re-calibrate the prospect’s value-meter. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=446">446</a> ^ref-63272</p>
<hr>
<p>We want to make an offer that’s so different that you can skip the awkward explanation of why your product is different from everyone elses (which, if they have to ask, then they are probably too ignorant to understand the explanation) and instead just have the offer do that work for you. That’s the Grand Slam Offer way. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=471">471</a> ^ref-52535</p>
<hr>
<p>have a saying I use to train sales teams “The pain is the pitch.” If you can articulate the pain a prospect is feeling accurately, they will almost always buy what you are offering. A prospect must have a painful problem for us to solve and charge money for our solution. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=557">557</a> ^ref-50990</p>
<hr>
<p>The point of good writing is for the reader to understand. The point of good persuasion is for the prospect to feel understood. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=560">560</a> ^ref-60917</p>
<hr>
<p>Think about what you are good at in regards to health, wealth, and relationships. Then think about who might value your service the most (is in the most pain), has the buying power to pay what you want (money), and can be found easily (targeting). As long as those three criteria are strong and the market isn't shrinking, you’ll be in good shape. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=588">588</a> ^ref-50772</p>

<p>For most, if you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=623">623</a> ^ref-24862</p>
<hr>
<p>But in order to maintain product focus, and high converting messaging, knowing exactly who the product was for was a game changer. It helped us know exactly who we were speaking to at all times. And exactly whose problems we were solving. But simplicity and ease may not be enough to sway you, so let me illustrate why honing in on one niche will make you more money. Reason: you can literally charge 100x more for the exact same product. Dan Kennedy was the first person to illustrate this for me, and I will do my best to pass on the torch to you in these pages. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=636">636</a> ^ref-34465</p>

<p>If you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you’ll likely never need to work again (seriously). — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=669">669</a> ^ref-42961</p>
<hr>
<p>The first step to making crazy money is charging premium prices. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=672">672</a> ^ref-24057</p>

<hr>
<p>So the goal of our Grand Slam Offer will be to get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only after we have sufficiently increased our value. This way, they still get a great deal (think buying $100,000 of value for $10,000). It’s ‘money at a discount.’ — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=732">732</a> ^ref-53799</p>
<hr>
<p>we are not trying to get the most customers. We are trying to make the most money. That being said, since there is no strategic benefit to being the second-lowest priced player in your marketplace. Allow me to give you a brief overview of why I see premium pricing as not only a very smart business decision, but a moral one. Furthermore, it’s the only choice that will allow you to truly provide the most value, a unique and strong position in the marketplace. Let me introduce you to the virtuous cycle of price. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=751">751</a> ^ref-8921</p>
<hr>
<p>In essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What’s more, the higher the price, the more allure your product or service has. People want to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn’t just to be slightly above the market price — the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, “This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=784">784</a> ^ref-41563</p>
<hr>
<p>One final point I want to drive home: if you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the result, or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested. The more invested they are, the more likely they are to achieve the positive result. Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it stings a little when they buy. That sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most attention. And if your customers are more adherent and follow through, and if they achieve better results with your service than your competition, then you are in a very real way providing more value than anyone else. This is how you win. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=789">789</a> ^ref-15116</p>

<p>there are four primary drivers of value. Two of the drivers (on top), you will seek to increase. The other two (on the bottom), you will seek to decrease. (Yay) The Dream Outcome (Goal: Increase) (Yay) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal: Increase) (Boo) Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement (Goal: Decrease) (Boo) Perceived Effort &amp; Sacrifice (Goal: Decrease) — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=872">872</a> ^ref-36643</p>

<p>What will I make? (Dream Outcome) How will I know it's going to happen? (Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) How long will it take? (Time Delay) What is expected of me? (Effort &amp; Sacrifice) Get The Bottom To Zero In the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement (social proof, third-party edification, etc). In other words, the top side of the equation. That’s where beginner marketers make bigger and bigger claims. It’s easy, and it’s lazy. But as time has gone on, I have realized that these larger-than-life claims are the easiest to establish (and therefore less unique). After all, anyone can make a promise. The harder, and more competitive, are the Time Delay and Effort &amp; Sacrifice. The best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation. Making things immediate, seamless, and effortless. Apple made the iPhone effortless compared to other phones at the time. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=877">877</a> ^ref-37361</p>
<hr>
<p>if you can reduce your prospects' true time delay to receiving value to zero (aka you realize your immediate dream outcome), and your effort and sacrifice is zero, you have an infinitely valuable product. If you accomplish this, you win the game. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=891">891</a> ^ref-57109</p>
<hr>
<p>The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice. A prime example of this happened in the London tunnel system. The biggest increase in rider satisfaction (aka value) was never from faster trains to decrease wait times. Instead, it was from a simple dotted map that showed them when the next train was coming and how long they had to wait. The dotted map, which only cost a few million dollars, decreased the riders’ perception of time delay and sacrifice (being bored waiting) more than actually making the trains faster (which costs billions of dollars to do). Isn’t that cool? This is how we need to think about our products. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=900">900</a> ^ref-60377</p>

<p>The dream outcome is the expression of the feelings and experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=928">928</a> ^ref-17687</p>

<p>Talk in terms of things your prospect believes will increase their status, and you will have your prospects drooling. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=950">950</a> ^ref-14114</p>

<p>Frame benefits in terms of status gained from the viewpoint of others When writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how other people will perceive the prospect’s achievement. Connect the dots for them. Example: If you buy this golf club, your drive will increase by 40 yards. Your golf buddies' jaws will drop when they see your ball soar 40 yards past theirs . . . they’ll ask you what’s changed . . . only you will know. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=951">951</a> ^ref-52709</p>

<p>The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their “dream outcome.” But the thing that makes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience. These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way that shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer. We want clients to have a big emotional win early (as close as possible to their purchase). This gives them the emotional buy in and the momentum to “see it through” to their ultimate goal. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=977">977</a> ^ref-59360</p>

<p>What level of personal attention do I want to provide? one-on-one, small group, one to many What level of effort is expected from them? Do it themselves (DIY) - figure out how to do it on their own; do it with them (DWY) - you teach them how to do it; done for them (DFY) - you do it for them If doing something live, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in? In-person, phone support, email support, text support, Zoom support, chat support If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it? Audio, video, or written. How quickly do we want to reply? On what days? during what hours? 24/7. 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour, within 24 hrs? 10x to 1/10th test. If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me 1/10th the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I still make them successful for 1/10th price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you’ll come up with widely different solutions. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=1292">1292</a> ^ref-11426</p>

<p>The Final High Value Deliverable Let’s sum this up before we configure our final high value deliverable. Step #1: We figured out our prospective client's dream outcome. Step #2: We listed out all the obstacles they’re likely to encounter on their way (our opportunities for value). Step #3: We listed all those obstacles as solutions. Step #4: We figured out all the different ways we could deliver those solutions. Step #5a: We trimmed those ways down to only the things that were the highest value and lowest cost to us. All we have to do now is… Step #5b: Put all the bundles together into the ultimate high value deliverable. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B099QVG1H8&amp;location=1352">1352</a> ^ref-26036</p>
