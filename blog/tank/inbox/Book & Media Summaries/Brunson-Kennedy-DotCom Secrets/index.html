<p>A percentage of your audience will always want to pay you the premium to get more value. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00U3817WE&amp;location=536">536</a> ^ref-60015</p>

<p>So instead of trying to convince someone to buy the most expensive offering right away, we build a funnel that will help us to do two things: 1 Provide value to each customer at the unique level of service that he or she can afford. 2 Make money and be profitable while identifying our dream clients who can afford our highest offer. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B00U3817WE&amp;location=572">572</a> ^ref-10302</p>
