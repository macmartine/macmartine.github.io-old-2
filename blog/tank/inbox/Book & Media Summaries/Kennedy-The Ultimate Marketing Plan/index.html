<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>Getting the right message to the right people via the right media and methods—effectively, efficiently, and profitably. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=106">106</a> ^ref-39684</p>

<p>(For a comprehensive exploration of the numbers by which marketing should be managed and a business run, don’t ask your accountant. He’s a historian. Consult Chapter 43 of my book No B.S. Ruthless Management of People and Profits.) — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=111">111</a> ^ref-51805</p>

<p>In both places, you are literally surrounded by competitors’ advertising. With other types of media, particularly direct mail, you can get and hold one-on-one attention, deliver a complete message, with no instant opportunity and little temptation to check out what twenty or 200 others in your category have to offer. My phrase for this is “selling in a vacuum,” and it is a very desirable thing to engineer. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=197">197</a> ^ref-38410</p>
<hr>
<p>Still, despite this obvious, extreme competitiveness, your stick-counted list will glaringly reveal one astounding fact: everybody is saying the same thing. Everybody is delivering the same message. And, with very rare exception, they are unfocused messages. They are big and broad and not really for anyone in particular. While this seems to be the way to do things, because that’s the way everybody is doing things, it is definitely the wrong approach if you seek exceptional success, even dominance, in your marketplace. Contrary to all this me-tooism, the key to the vault in marketing in general and in these toughest media in particular is a message that differentiates you from all your competitors in a positive, appealing, preferably compelling way. Many marketing pros call this a “Unique Selling Proposition.” Without this, you are merely a choice. With it, you can be the choice. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=204">204</a> ^ref-34154</p>

<p>Actually, that’s where you start. Keeping in mind everything we’ve discussed in this chapter, get a large pile of blank 3&quot; × 5&quot; cards and start putting one fact, feature, benefit, promise, offer component, and idea on each card—until you have, over a series of brainstorming sessions, exhausted everything you know about your business and its competitors. Then do your best to prioritize the items, in order of their probable importance to your customers and their contribution to differentiating you from your competition. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=504">504</a> ^ref-51197</p>

<p>Go back to the Yellow Pages and again turn to the ads in your section (or visit the websites you visited before) and, of course, examine your own marketing materials. Ask yourself whether or not, from the headline on down, the ads present their messages according to the organized structure above. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=568">568</a> ^ref-57595</p>

<p>Many advisors who advertise, offer seminars, or use direct mail to solicit appointments skip to step 2 or, worse, step 3. They begin by talking about financial products and services or, even worse, about themselves —but in doing so, they’re often talking to deaf ears, because their prospects are not aware there’s anything to be worried about with the way they have their affairs arranged now or think they’ve “heard all this before.” These prospects are besieged by insurance salespeople, financial planners, investment advisors, banks, etc., trying to sell them insurance, annuities, living trusts, and estate plans. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=617">617</a> ^ref-41869</p>

<p>The word “secret” evokes a powerful emotional response in most people. It instantly hits our curiosity button. For some reason, just as cats are bothered by closed doors, we are driven nuts by secrets. We want to know. You can ignite interest easily if you have secrets to divulge. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=641">641</a> ^ref-30484</p>

<p>Many people answer the best hamburgers in town, or a secret sauce, or a great cook, or a commanding name, logo, or character, like Ronald McDonald, or a huge bankroll for a major advertising campaign. But Gary’s answer was: a starving crowd. Success factor #3 is a starving crowd or the close equivalent—highly motivated, highly responsive customers—for your products, services, or business. It is my contention this is paramount, above all else, more important than all other factors. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=726">726</a> ^ref-28792</p>

<p>You want to rule out hunks of any geographic area you’re marketing in. You want to be able to skip streets or blocks or neighborhoods or apartment buildings or entire zip codes. You want to reduce the size of your prospect universe so that you are using your resources efficiently and can spend more on each “best” prospect because you are spending less, little, or nothing on bad prospects. Get this: Your net profits from marketing will be determined more by your diligence with this discriminatory selection of prospects than by anything else. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=820">820</a> ^ref-20703</p>

<p>Every medium has and can provide detailed demographic information about its readers, listeners, viewers, or customers. While some media’s data are more reliable than others, most are pretty accurate—the media need this same data to make good editorial, programming, or product selections. You can and should take this information very seriously when making media decisions. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=839">839</a> ^ref-54798</p>

<p>List research is best conducted yourself, painstakingly, at www.SRDS.com. It is not as easy as just calling a local list broker and leaving it up to them, unless all you want is a demographic list compiled from public data. You can also find demographic lists online at www.InfoUSA.com. But if you’re going after response lists, go to SRDS.com. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=853">853</a> ^ref-2375</p>

<p>So he sits down with his list broker and says: “In these zips, I want married homeowners with kids, with household income of $30,000.00 and up, who have MasterCards or VISA cards.” Using lists derived from the census, credit card holder lists, property ownership records, and other readily available sources, the broker can deliver that exact list or something very close to it. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=884">884</a> ^ref-51506</p>
<hr>
<p>Incidentally, it can be helpful to collect demographic data about your present customers. If you find certain biases or commonalities in your present customers, you may be able to use them in your criteria for future targeting. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=887">887</a> ^ref-20108</p>

<p>If it’s worth it to him, and it might very well be, he could experiment with response lists rather than compiled lists—and were he marketing to more affluent homeowners, I’d definitely suggest it. Martha Stewart Living subscribers or buyers of books on entertaining at home, active customers of a home furnishings catalog, or buyers of kitchen gadgets might be productive, as it seems they are “about” their home and home life. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=889">889</a> ^ref-26818</p>
<hr>
<p>Today, a must-buy-now buyer has to be worth a great deal more than any ordinary buyer who may or may not buy now but can just as easily postpone, procrastinate, or prevaricate. The marketer can and should invest considerably more in finding and wooing that must-buy-now buyer. He’s worth more, so you can invest more. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=957">957</a> ^ref-33483</p>
<hr>
<p>Combine the must-buy-now buyer with the affluent can-buy-now buyer and you’ve really got something. This is demographic plus situational. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=960">960</a> ^ref-12821</p>

<p>My research indicates that people don’t even believe guarantees. They say: “Yeah, just try to get your money back. You’ve got to bring it back still wrapped in the original plastic, fill out a sixteen-part form, stand in line for three hours, and scream and yell and threaten their lives.” I believe you should use, even lean heavily on, guarantees. But you have to go to extremes to make people believe them. If you use testimonials—and I’m going to tell you that you should— they say: “I’ll bet those are actors” or “I’ll bet they’re just made up” or “I’ll bet they paid those people to say those things.” Here is the Ultimate Marketing Plan “Be Safe or Sorry” rule: Prove every single item in your case. Prove every statement, assertion, claim, promise, offer, and warranty. Leave nothing unproven. Never presume trust or acceptance. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=995">995</a> ^ref-23078</p>

<p>Today it is very easy to incorporate photographic and video evidence into presentations on websites and other online media, and many marketers do because there is abundant evidence that doing so boosts response. But nobody should stop with what’s easy. This kind of evidence should be incorporated into every media and every sales environment that is part of your business. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=1063">1063</a> ^ref-9471</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m going to let you in on a secret: As common amongst top marketers and as well-proven from the early 1900s to this day as testimonial use is, the absence or underuse of testimonials remains the number one marketing error I see repeated most frequently. I can promise you this: If you get nothing else out of this entire book but the inspiration to collect and heavily use as many good testimonials as you can possibly get, in as many places and ways as you can, you’ll have a strong competitive advantage from that alone. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=1114">1114</a> ^ref-50773</p>
<hr>
<p>For starters, think of a testimonial as a pair of verbal “snapshots.” The first is the “Before” picture—the problem or the skepticism; the second is the “After” picture—the positive result, the pleasant surprise, the solution. “I was fat, lonely, frightened, poor, unhappy, skeptical, etc.— now, thanks to XYZ, I’m thin, popular, confident, rich, happy, and a believer!” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=1119">1119</a> ^ref-10483</p>
<hr>
<p>Second, view testimonials as strategic weapons. I suggest making two lists; one of every claim, feature, benefit, and fact about what you’re marketing that you want to substantiate; second, every doubt, fear, or question that might exist in your prospective customer’s mind. Then collect and use testimonials that specifically substantiate the claims that eliminate the doubts. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=1128">1128</a> ^ref-49623</p>

<p>When using a number of these testimonials in one message, you want to try to cover as many claim-benefit bases and as many demographic bases as possible. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=1165">1165</a> ^ref-55072</p>

<p>Sometimes even an endorsement of your general industry is useful. Some years back, Joe Montana, then playing for the San Francisco 49ers football team, stated that he relied on chiropractors to keep him healthy. Any chiropractor who failed to make use of this was just plain dumb. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=1175">1175</a> ^ref-18634</p>

<p>Same idea, turned around: Every minute of every day, 24-7-365, a new member joins the Whatsis Society! That’s about 520,000 new members. And that’s a lot. But what if it’s every hour—that still sounds impressive, maybe more impressive than 8,760 new members. Obviously, how you present numbers matters. IT’S UP TO YOU to identify every stat you’ve got and to present them in interesting ways that demonstrate something meaningful and reassuring. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=1257">1257</a> ^ref-20938</p>

<p>One of the biggest points Paul hammers home is that the media is not interested in giving you free advertising, but the media is eager for information and stories that will intrigue, interest, or entertain their readers, listeners, and viewers. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=1683">1683</a> ^ref-22819</p>

<p>Sadly, “cold” telephone prospecting to consumers is now outlawed for all who’ve put themselves on the Do Not Call Registry, dicey with others, and less welcome by many than ever before.

<p>“It’s no harder to fall in love with a rich man.” Similarly, it is not much more difficult to bring in ideal, high-value customers than it is to bring in any customer with a pulse, but most marketers think “anybody, everybody, and as many as possible” rather than think about the equity they are creating. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B005307LCW&amp;location=2220">2220</a> ^ref-39198</p>
