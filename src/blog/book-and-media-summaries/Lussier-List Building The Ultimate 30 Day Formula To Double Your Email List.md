Some of the biggest blogs and websites on the web do well by having a “pop up” opt-in form, that appears a few seconds after someone lands on the website. The best plugin that allows you to set up these pop-ups is called PopupAlly, it’s got both a free version and a premium one that gives you more control over when and how the pop-up appears. — location: [253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G2QU8MG&location=253) ^ref-19625

2. Do you have a link to your squeeze page in your navigation bar? 3. Do you have an opt-in box on every page? 4. Do you have opt-in box at the end of each of your blog posts? Check out the tutorial I created to make this happen.  5. Take a look at your site’s traffic statistics… which are your top visited pages? Can you add a paragraph that encourages people to opt-in somewhere on that page or post? 6. Do you have older opt-in offers that you haven’t updated or maintained? If you’ve had webinars or past opt-in offers, decide if you want to forward these pages to your new opt-in or if you need to refresh the thank you page and welcome emails. — location: [293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G2QU8MG&location=293) ^ref-29207

Here are my top tips for writing a great guest post: 1. Start with the core concept of the article, then mind map some of the associated tips, strategies, or ideas.  2. Think of a story you can weave into the article and how it relates to the topic at hand.  3. If noticed themes or a number of ideas that could be subheadings, write them out first as an outline for your post.  4. Write your introduction, then fill in the subsections. Insert your story at the start of the article, or under a sub heading if it’s more specific.  5. Write the conclusion… but don’t fill in your author biography yet, we’ll be covering how to do that in detail in tomorrow’s video.  6. Go back to the title of your article and see if you can make it more specific, memorable, and add in a little curiosity.  7. Finally, go through your article one more time from start to finish to fix an inconsistencies, grammar and typos, and add any missing pieces of information. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G2QU8MG&location=322) ^ref-44411
