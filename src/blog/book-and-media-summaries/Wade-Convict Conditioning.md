Sometimes—maybe after a hard day, or just through laziness—you don’t always want to work out when your allotted training time comes around. This happens to the best of us from time to time. But you get down to the work anyway, get done what you need to get done. Afterwards, you get that corresponding hit of accomplishment, a mental and physical high that would have otherwise been replaced by long, dull, wasted minutes or hours. — location: [4490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0B8QDFQNW&location=4490) ^ref-48998

Once you get past Step 6 on all four of the exercises mentioned, it’s time to move to the next program. — location: [4538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0B8QDFQNW&location=4538) ^ref-4817
