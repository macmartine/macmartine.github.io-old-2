Using some sophisticated programming, and lots of experimentation to get it right, the team figured out a seamless way to cross-publish Airbnb listings on Craigslist, free of cost, so that whenever someone searched the popular classifieds site for a vacation rental, listings for properties on Airbnb popped up. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=203) ^ref-4097

---
collaborative teams that bring together staff with expertise in analytics, engineering, product management, and marketing, growth hacking allows companies to efficiently marry powerful data analysis and technical know-how with marketing savvy, to quickly devise more promising ways to fuel growth. — location: [221](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=221) ^ref-59494

---
In the process, the growth hacking method broke down the traditional walls between marketing and engineering in order to discover novel methods of marketing that are built into the product itself, and can only be tapped with more technical know-how. — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=249) ^ref-60783

---
At early stage start-ups, avoiding these silos from the start is advised, but as a start-up grows, more traditional marketing groups can be established alongside a dedicated growth team. — location: [309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=309) ^ref-62901

“If you’re pushing code once every two weeks and your competitor is pushing code every week, just after two months that competitor will have done 10 times as many tests as you. That competitor will have learned 10 times, an order of magnitude more about their product [than you].” — location: [364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=364) ^ref-64158

---
In addition, the engineering team realized that it could marry the data Walmart was collecting as part of its price matching program with the ad campaigns being run by their paid search teams, leading to big savings in ad spend by only bidding aggressively on items where they were the clear price leader. — location: [382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=382) ^ref-1491

“73 percent of CEOs think marketers lack business credibility and are not effectiveness-focused enough,” — location: [408](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=408) ^ref-52502

and 72 percent of CEOs agreed with the statement that marketers “are always asking for money but can rarely explain how much incremental business this money will generate.”25 — location: [409](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=409) ^ref-21640

---
Throughout the book we show that, in reality, growth hacking is a team effort, that the greatest successes come from combining programming know-how with expertise in data analytics and strong marketing experience, and very few individuals are proficient in all of these skills. — location: [433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=433) ^ref-10538

Customer disengagement and flight, known as bounces for website visitors, and churn for paying customers, are two of the biggest problems for start-ups and established firms alike and consequently represent some of the best immediate opportunities for growth. — location: [452](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=452) ^ref-16789

---
A growth lead might establish a monthly, quarterly, or even annual focus area, such as to get more users to upgrade from a free version of a product to a premium version, or to determine which would be the best new marketing channel for a product. The growth lead then ensures that the team is not derailed by pursuing ideas that don’t contribute to their stated goal, tabling those for when the focus changes and those ideas will serve the new objective. — location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=631) ^ref-47393

---
All growth leads require a basic set of skills: fluency in data analysis; expertise or fluency in product management (meaning the process of developing and launching a product); and an understanding of how to design and run experiments. — location: [640](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=640) ^ref-34089

---
There is no one best career background for a growth lead. Some people are now specializing in the role, most of whom have moved into the job from some other area of specialty, such as engineering, product management, data science, or marketing. People with expertise in each of these areas are good candidates for the role, because they each bring strengths key to the growth hacking process. For start-ups, especially in the early stage of growth, often the founder should play the role of growth lead. — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=650) ^ref-38535

---
The process is a continuous cycle comprising four key steps: (1) data analysis and insight gathering; (2) idea generation; (3) experiment prioritization; and (4) running the experiments, and then circles back to the analyze step to review results and decide the next steps. — location: [728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=728) ^ref-16331

---
So, for example, an in-depth analysis of customer churn (meaning identifying those who recently abandoned the product) might reveal that the people who are defecting haven’t made use of a particular feature of the product that is popular with avid users. — location: [747](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=747) ^ref-20321

In 2008, for example, the company realized that it was losing traffic to a rival upstart, Trulia, largely due to Trulia’s smart use of search engine optimization to rank its home listing data higher than Zillow’s in Google search results. — location: [801](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=801) ^ref-54611

Facebook. In contrast to product-led teams’ specific dedication to a particular product, independent teams have the authority to conduct experiments across the full range of the company’s products, and even to look for strategic opportunities for growth outside of the scope of the current product lineup. — location: [834](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=834) ^ref-64210

---
It’s just as important that the growth team machine not be put into drive too early. Because all the rapid experimentation in the world won’t ignite lasting growth if the product isn’t loved by the people who use it. — location: [935](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=935) ^ref-1979

---
One of the cardinal rules of growth hacking is that you must not move into the high-tempo growth experimentation push until you know your product is must-have, why it’s must-have, and to whom it is a must-have: in other words, what is its core value, to which customers, and why. — location: [958](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=958) ^ref-21684

---
If you haven’t created and identified core value before you make your growth push, you’ll either end up with illusory growth at best or market rejection at worst. — location: [966](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=966) ^ref-62602

---
A pernicious misconception about growth hacking is that it is primarily about building virality into products. That is indeed one of the key tactics, but like other growth efforts, it must only be deployed after the product has been determined a must-have. — location: [972](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=972) ^ref-51703

---
“What we’ve learned is that there are times when you can get some spike of virality, but if you really want that long-term major user growth it’s got to start with a good product. — location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1005) ^ref-33144

---
“love creates growth, not the other way around.” And for there to be love, there needs to be that aha moment.9 — location: [1014](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1014) ^ref-48008

---
The team then created 20 million profiles for small businesses in the Bay Area on the site and encouraged users to add their reviews. Growth took off. — location: [1024](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1024) ^ref-22689

---
Thus the key to knowing when it’s time to start the high-tempo push for growth is simple: Can you identify an aha moment that users love? — location: [1036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1036) ^ref-59391

---
So a vital step in determining whether your product has the aha potential is to seek out truly avid fans by mining user data and feedback, and then to search for any similarities in the ways these people use the product for hints about what value they get from your product that less enthused users perhaps aren’t. — location: [1057](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1057) ^ref-40621

---
if 40 percent or more of responses are “very disappointed,” then the product has achieved sufficient must-have status, — location: [1070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1070) ^ref-24296

---
If 25 to 40 percent of respondents answer “very disappointed,” then often what’s needed are tweaks either to the product or to the language used to describe the product and how to use it. — location: [1073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1073) ^ref-22974

---
In these cases, a set of additional questions on the Must-Have Survey will help to point you toward your next steps: — location: [1076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1076) ^ref-36885

---
If you don’t have a large enough base of beta users to get about that number, you should be relying more on customer interviews instead, as having just a handful of survey responses can lead to false signals. — location: [1100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1100) ^ref-12776

---
The second measure to use in assessing whether or not you’ve achieved must-have status is your product’s retention rate, which is simply the number of people who continue to use your product over a given time. — location: [1113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1113) ^ref-2891

---
The retention rate is simply calculated as the percentage of users who continue to use or pay for your product, generally tracked month to month. — location: [1124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1124) ^ref-18704

---
Business products, such as software as a service, fare much better, with annual retention rates north of 90 percent, according to a study of private SaaS companies done by Pacific Crest in 2013.13 — location: [1137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1137) ^ref-11849

growth. If you’ve determined the product hasn’t made the grade, the first thing to do is to stop yourself from doing something that feels all too natural: guessing at what the elusive feature might be that may make your product more appealing to your customers. — location: [1145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1145) ^ref-47358

Etsy smartly singled out influential artists, crafters, and vintage collectors and actually took them to lunch to understand their motivations, i.e., what aspect of the selling experience they considered most important, and what kind of aha moment it would require to convince them to shift that experience to Etsy. — location: [1181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1181) ^ref-57700

What you want to create is what’s often called a data lake or data warehouse: a single location where all customer information is stored and where you can really dive in and uncover distinctive groupings of users who may be using the product differently from other groups. — location: [1312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1312) ^ref-42405

Can you track the complete path of what a customer does starting when they first visit your physical store or website all the way up through making their first purchase and then subsequent ones? If there are gaps there, those are the events worth tracking first. — location: [1325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1325) ^ref-3927

Remember that all of this experimentation and analysis should be focused on discovering the aha moment you are offering, or can offer, customers. — location: [1390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1390) ^ref-36311

James Currier, a successful entrepreneur and growth expert turned venture capitalist, suggests that one-third of a company’s engineering time goes to getting the new user experience down just right. — location: [1412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1412) ^ref-44899

Once you have discovered a market of avid users and your aha moment—i.e., once product/market fit has been achieved—then you can begin to build systematically on that foundation to create a high-powered, high-tempo growth machine. — location: [1416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1416) ^ref-27848

Growth hacking is not about throwing ideas against the wall as fast as you can to see what sticks, it’s about applying rapid experimentation to find and then optimize the most promising areas of opportunity. — location: [1465](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1465) ^ref-20449

Instead, small teams must focus on those tests that promise to have the highest potential for impact first. — location: [1486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1486) ^ref-5625

---
The way to determine your essential metrics is to identify the actions that correlate most directly to users experiencing the core value of your product, such as, for Facebook, how many people users invite to join their friend circle, how frequently they visit the site, how many posts and comments they make, and how much time they spend on the site. — location: [1516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1516) ^ref-32178

---
You want to track, at a minimum, the metrics for each of the steps users must take to reach the aha moment and how often they are taking those steps. — location: [1519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1519) ^ref-55249

To hone your growth equation and narrow your focus, it’s best to choose one, key metric of ultimate success that all growth activity is geared toward. — location: [1560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1560) ^ref-8541

---
The North Star should be the metric that most accurately captures the core value you create for your customers. To determine what that is you must ask yourself: Which of the variables in your growth equation best represents the delivery of that must-have experience you identified for your product? — location: [1567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1567) ^ref-33257

To begin, they looked at their data to identify markets where bookings were lagging and, to their surprise, discovered that New York City was underachieving. — location: [1601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1601) ^ref-43063

---
Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, refers to getting your data tracking set up to be able to do so as “instrumentation.” Much as an airplane can’t fly without instruments providing information about altitude, air pressure, and wind speed constantly being monitored, without the right data at your fingertips, your growth team will be flying blind.13 — location: [1633](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1633) ^ref-944

---
For one, metrics should be presented as ratios rather than static numbers. For example, reporting on the total number of users acquired is static and tells you little, but new users acquired per day or week is much better, because it can be compared with previous time periods to see if the rate is rising or falling. — location: [1714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1714) ^ref-36125

---
Numbers also need to be accompanied by an indicator if they are above trend, below, or on par with past performance. This can be done by showing the percentage change over the previous period or using an indicator such as color to let the team know when a number is ahead or behind of where it typically should be. — location: [1716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1716) ^ref-2027

The companies that grow the fastest are the ones that learn the fastest. The more experiments you run, the more you learn. It’s really that simple. — location: [1780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=1780) ^ref-29360

Instead he completely reframed how people thought about the appeal of portable music players with the simple and captivating phrase “1,000 Songs in Your Pocket.” Rather than spend his time trying to differentiate his product from others on price or features, in other words, Jobs understood that the core value, the magical aha experience, was carrying your entire music library around with you anywhere, all the time, totally hassle free. — location: [2266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01IZTCF6Y&location=2266) ^ref-5224

“It is very likely that one channel is optimal. Most businesses actually get zero distribution channels to work. Poor distribution—not product—is the number one cause of failure. If you can get even a single distribution channel to work, you have great business.
