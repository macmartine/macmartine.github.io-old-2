				<h3>The role of luck in life</h3>
<p>In business and in life, we tend to over-estimate the predictability of the outcome of our actions.</p>
<p>Most of the things we do in life involve an immense amount of luck and chance.  There are literally infinite events in the history of the world that lead to any singular event actually taking place.</p>
<ul>
<li>If my uncle hadn't introduced my father to his sister, my parents would have never met. I wouldn't be here. My wife wouldn't have married me. My kids wouldn't exist. Two other kids that didn't get into the school they go to would have gotten in, and their lives would in turn have different trajectories.</li>
<li>If I hadn't decided to drop my high-school girlfriend off at her college, I wouldn't have ended up moving to Oregon at that time, and therefore every event in my life after that time would be very different. As would the lives of everyone around me now, and the lives of anyone that would have been around my had a ended up on a different path.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on and on, back to the beginning of time. It's mind-blowing, and beautiful.</p>
<p>Create 10-trillion worlds and it's unlikely that the outcome would be even remotely the same as what it is today.</p>
<p>In this context, it's pretty easy to understand</p>
<p>What can be easy to overlook is the role of this in our day-to-day in events we feel like we have control over. We tend to expect a binary result, that you will either get a particular outcome or you won't.</p>
<h3>The role of luck in business</h3>
<p>Here's a great, simple example of the same event taking place at different times, with very different outcomes. (Thanks to @dvassallo for bringing this example to my attention.)</p>
<p>Tony Dinh is an indiepreneur, making and marketing his own products. He had tried promoting one of his projects on a particular website, and gotten very little response. Then, 9 months later, someone posted the same link with the same subject, and it got 174 times as much attention.</p>
<p>The difference in outcomes cannot be attributed to Tony's effort or execution, but rather the unpredictability of human behavior and chance. The alignment of an infinite amount of possibilities, if you will.</p>

<h3>Takeaway</h3>
<p>Think about where you want to be tomorrow, and work backwards. What you can do today to improve the odds that you'll see the outcome you desire? What's the worst-case scenario?</p>
<p>Take action to improve your odds at achieving the outcome you desire, while simultaneously preparing for the unknown, the unpredictable. Sometimes this means planning for the worst. Other times you just may not want to put all your eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>If you succeed, resist taking all the credit. If you fail, don't take all the blame.</p>
<p>Hopefully you won't let this scare you, but you'll embrace the beauty of it.</p>
<p>Know that your choices today, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">greatly impact your tomorrow, and the world around you</a>.</p>
