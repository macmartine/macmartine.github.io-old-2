## Highlights
You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you. — location: [35](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=35) ^ref-47000

Apathy, the main symptom of the second phase, was a necessary mechanism of self-defense. — location: [406](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=406) ^ref-35875

What did the prisoner dream about most frequently? Of bread, cake, cigarettes, and nice warm baths. — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=412) ^ref-51183

The truth—that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way —an honorable way—in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. — location: [519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=519) ^ref-55088

---
Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance. — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=532) ^ref-21626

This intensification of inner life helped the prisoner find a refuge from the emptiness, desolation and spiritual poverty of his existence, by letting him escape into the past. When given free rein, his imagination played with past events, often not important ones, but minor happenings and trifling things. His nostalgic memory glorified them and they assumed a strange character. Their world and their existence seemed very distant and the spirit reached out for them longingly: In my mind I took bus rides, unlocked the front door of my apartment, answered my telephone, switched on the electric lights. Our thoughts often centered on such details, and these memories could move one to tears. As the inner life of the prisoner tended to become more intense, he also experienced the beauty of art and nature as never before. — location: [539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=539) ^ref-19105

Humor was another of the soul’s weapons in the fight for self-preservation. — location: [590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=590) ^ref-23488

---
To draw an analogy: a man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative. — location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=602) ^ref-11566

everything that was not connected with the immediate task of keeping oneself and one’s closest friends alive lost its value. — location: [668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=668) ^ref-9489

---
Under the influence of a world which no longer recognized the value of human life and human dignity, which had robbed man of his will and had made him an object to be exterminated (having planned, however, to make full use of him first—to the last ounce of his physical resources)—under this influence the personal ego finally suffered a loss of values. — location: [670](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=670) ^ref-13018

We can answer these questions from experience as well as on principle. The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action. There were enough examples, often of a heroic nature, which proved that apathy could be overcome, irritability suppressed. Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress. — location: [858](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=858) ^ref-9759

---
everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way. — location: [862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=862) ^ref-27435

Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insuffcient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him—mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. Dostoevski said once, “There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.” These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost. It can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom—which cannot be taken away—that makes life meaningful and purposeful. — location: [868](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=868) ^ref-36190

An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature. But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man’s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. A creative life and a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete. The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not. — location: [875](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=875) ^ref-25345

Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through his own suffering. — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=888) ^ref-18015

---
Such people forgot that often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself. Instead of taking the camp’s difficulties as a test of their inner strength, they did not take their life seriously and despised it as something of no consequence. They preferred to close their eyes and to live in the past. Life for such people became meaningless. — location: [938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=938) ^ref-21325

---
One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners. — location: [945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=945) ^ref-52857

Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it. — location: [963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=963) ^ref-39376

Those who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man—his courage and hope, or lack of them—and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect. — location: [981](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=981) ^ref-51142

“He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how,” — location: [992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=992) ^ref-40825

We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general way. — location: [998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=998) ^ref-17383

---
When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden. — location: [1009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1009) ^ref-13103

Suffering had become a task on which we did not want to turn our backs. We had realized its hidden opportunities for achievement, — location: [1016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1016) ^ref-47958

---
there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer. — location: [1020](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1020) ^ref-12422

---
When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the “why” for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any “how.” — location: [1033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1033) ^ref-46541

I said that each of us had to ask himself what irreplaceable losses he had suffered up to then. I speculated that for most of them these losses had really been few. Whoever was still alive had reason for hope. Health, family, happiness, professional abilities, fortune, position in society —all these were things that could be achieved again or restored. After all, we still had all our bones intact. Whatever we had gone through could still be an asset to us in the future. And I quoted from Nietzsche: “Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich stärker.” (That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.) — location: [1055](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1055) ^ref-32794

Only slowly could these men be guided back to the commonplace truth that no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them. — location: [1162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1162) ^ref-45332

Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future. (Logotherapy, indeed, is a meaning-centered psychotherapy.) — location: [1213](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1213) ^ref-15733

---
Logotherapy, or, as it has been called by some authors, “The Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy,” focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on man’s search for such a meaning. According to logotherapy, this striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man. — location: [1220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1220) ^ref-43695

---
This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy his own will to meaning. — location: [1226](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1226) ^ref-2613

---
Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. — location: [1290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1290) ^ref-12999

---
What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. — location: [1295](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1295) ^ref-48835

No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism). — location: [1310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1310) ^ref-63622

The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. Now we can understand Schopenhauer when he said that mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate eternally between the two extremes of distress and boredom. In actual fact, boredom is now causing, and certainly bringing to psychiatrists, more problems to solve than distress. — location: [1314](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1314) ^ref-51590

---
As each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence. — location: [1341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1341) ^ref-13588

“Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!” — location: [1346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1346) ^ref-6564

---
By declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system. I have termed this constitutive characteristic “the self-transcendence of human existence.” It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence. — location: [1359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1359) ^ref-50351

---
According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. — location: [1366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1366) ^ref-36293

to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one’s predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation—just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer—we are challenged to change ourselves. — location: [1382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1382) ^ref-63087

In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice. — location: [1390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1390) ^ref-5688

For, in the past, nothing is irretrievably lost but everything irrevocably stored. — location: [1478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1478) ^ref-52727

the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? “No, thank you,” he will think. “Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. — location: [1488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1488) ^ref-39579

It is characteristic of this fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid. An individual, for example, who is afraid of blushing when he enters a large room and faces many people will actually be more prone to blush under these circumstances. In this context, one might amend the saying “The wish is father to the thought” to “The fear is mother of the event.” Ironically enough, in the same way that fear brings to pass what one is afraid of, likewise a forced intention makes impossible what one forcibly wishes. This excessive intention, or “hyper-intention,” as I call it, can be observed particularly in cases of sexual neurosis. The more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. — location: [1498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1498) ^ref-20293

In German I described paradoxical intention as early as 1939.10 In this approach the phobic patient is invited to intend, even if only for a moment, precisely that which he fears. — location: [1517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1517) ^ref-20756

---
The reader will note that this procedure consists of a reversal of the patient’s attitude, inasmuch as his fear is replaced by a paradoxical wish. By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of the anxiety. — location: [1524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1524) ^ref-9113

---
The fear of sleeplessness12 results in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. — location: [1553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1553) ^ref-40492

---
anticipatory anxiety has to be counteracted by paradoxical intention; hyper-intention as well as hyper-reflection have to be counteracted by dereflection; dereflection, however, ultimately is not possible except by the patient’s orientation toward his specific vocation and mission in life. — location: [1574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1574) ^ref-44087

To be sure, a human being is a finite thing, and his freedom is restricted. It is not freedom from conditions, but it is freedom to take a stand toward the conditions. — location: [1588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1588) ^ref-39926

---
In other words, man is ultimately self-determining. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment. — location: [1597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1597) ^ref-41793

---
Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. — location: [1617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B009U9S6FI&location=1617) ^ref-35980
