When faced with a decision, we humans are great at seeing the benefit to be gained that goes along with a particular choice, however, we are terrible at spotting the opportunity costs. Or rather, we don't take the time to look for them.
When considering a move the from the city to the suburbs, it may be easy to see the benefits of better schools, a bigger yard, and more bang for your buck in a home purchase. What may not be thought about until it's too late is the tripled commute time, and the unpredictability of the traffic, for example. This can be a big overlooked side-effect costing you an hour per-day, plus increased gas costs and car wear and tear.
