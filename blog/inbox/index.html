<p>I want to learn in public<br>
An overused Reid Hoffman's quote captures some of the idea of learning in public: “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.” -- related to being embarrassed by old work</p>

<p><strong>Lazy time encourages diffuse thinking.</strong> Our mind has two modes of thinking: the diffuse mode and the focused mode of thinking. We need to maintain constant oscillation between the two modes in order to be our most creative and productive. <a href="https://nesslabs.com/mind-wandering">Mind wandering</a>, a form of diffuse thinking, is a useful mechanism for our brains to process information—sometimes leading to non obvious solutions. Another benefit of letting our mind wander without paying any attention to a productive task is a higher focus on long-term goals, according to a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233768331_Letting_go_of_the_present_Mind-wandering_is_associated_with_reduced_delay_discounting">study</a> published in <em>Consciousness and Cognition</em>. A bit of lazy time today, for a more productive time tomorrow!</p>
