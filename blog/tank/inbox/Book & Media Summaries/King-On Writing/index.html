<p>When you’re six, most of your Bingo balls are still floating around in the draw-tank. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC0SIM&amp;location=215">215</a> ^ref-10449</p>

<p>“When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story,” he said. “When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.” — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC0SIM&amp;location=588">588</a> ^ref-44595</p>

<p>write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open. Your stuff starts out being just for you, in other words, but then it goes out. Once you know what the story is and get it right—as right as you can, anyway—it belongs to anyone who wants to read it. Or criticize it. If you’re very lucky (this is my idea, not John Gould’s, but I believe he would have subscribed to the notion), more will want to do the former than the latter. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC0SIM&amp;location=590">590</a> ^ref-46820</p>

<p>Running a close second was the realization that stopping a piece of work just because it’s hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to go on when you don’t feel like it, and sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B000FC0SIM&amp;location=849">849</a> ^ref-34884</p>
