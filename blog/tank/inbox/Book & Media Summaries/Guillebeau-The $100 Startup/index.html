<p>Value means helping people. If you’re trying to build a microbusiness and you begin your efforts by helping people, you’re on the right track.

These are the most important tasks of your business—not administration, maintenance, or anything else that takes time without creating wealth or value. If you’re not sure what to do, think about any of these ideas: Can you contact your customer list with a special offer or incentive?

But one way or another … just do something. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0067TGSOK&amp;location=597">597</a> ^ref-23526</p>
