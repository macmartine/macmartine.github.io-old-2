title: Your product does not need these things

Are you in the early stages of your SaaS and having a hard time finding time for it all?

I got you:

Before you have a solid initial customer base, you can remove all these things from your plate:

- Marketing website
- Amazing design
- Favicon
- More features
- Ability to scale
- Fancy deploy scripts
- Ticketing system
- Analytics
- Etc...

Focus on solving that one core problem, and doing it well.

Then spend the majority of your time reaching out to people, getting feedback, and bringing in customers.

If you're not, you're just a procrastinating on what needs to be done.
