## Thought: AI and the future

### Overview of the dispruptions in AI:

AI has been all the rage lately, with tools like <a href='https://chat.openai.com' target='_blank'>ChatGPT</a> getting massive amounts of attention for it's language capabilities, and <a href='https://www.midjourney.com/' target="_blank">Midjourney</a> and <a href='https://openai.com/dall-e-2/' target="_blank">DALL-E</a> for generating images from text prompts.

ChatGPT in particular has gained major traction for a wide-range of utilities, from article writing, to social media post writing, to creative writing, and even code generation and code debugging. Many have even started to use it in place of Google.

With these advancements come major consequences across many industries. The question is, are we ready? 

Today we're going to have an overview of the state of the effects these tools are having on the world today.

Let's start off with an overview of what the tools that are getting the most attention from the masses right now.

## What is ChatGPT?

At it's core, ChatGPT behaves similar to the how Google works in the sense of asking a question and getting a result. However, instead of scanning web pages and returning the page that Google thinks is the best result, ChatGPT is trained over a wide-array of resources, enabling it to interpret information and learn from it, and create unique responses that don't stem from a particular source. This allows it to respond in ways Google simply can't, including the ability to be creative.

Those are my words though; let's see what ChatGPT says it is, shall we?

## What are Midjourney and DALL-E?

<a href='https://www.midjourney.com/' target="_blank">Midjourney</a> and <a href='https://openai.com/dall-e-2/' target="_blank">DALL-E</a> are just a couple examples of a number of AI image generators. They are able to take a prompt and generate an image from it.

Here's an example from Midjourney, where I gave it the prompt: "a troll in a forest with vibrant colors and surreal sky", and got the following four images back:

Pretty cool, right?

Now that we have a general understanding of what these tools are, let's dive in to how they are changing the world today.

## AI and social media

The way these tools are starting to effect the masses the most today, is likely most seen in social media and the internet.

With ChatGPT, a user can do pretty much anything they want with it on their own. However, there have been a huge number of tools released lately to leverage this type of AI for specific purposes, such as writing social media posts for you, Tweets, LinkedIn posts, blog posts, articles, even <a href='https://emailtree.ai/fastest-email-composer/ai-email-response-generator/' target='_blank'>reply to your emails</a>, or <a href="https://detangle.ai/" target='_blank'>summarize legal documents</a> in layman's terms.

It's now easy to generate and schedule a month's worth of social media posts, that are fairly well-written about a subject, without having to do much of anything, or even know anything about the subject. Enter the world of robots acting as the facade of humans, Sometimes people can <a href='https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1604841600416624642' target='_blank'>tell the difference</a>, but most of the time, they can't. And honestly, most people aren't yet aware that they should consider this a possibility.

The core purpose of social media - at least on a personal level - of getting to know others online, follow interesting people, and staying in touch with old friends is getting really blurred. Sure, there have been bots online for a while now, but it's been pretty clear when you're dealing with a bot. Now any individual may or may not be running their online presence with a bot. It certainly has me questioning the value of social media going forward.

### Effects on the internet

The ability to have AI tools like ChatGPT generate massive amounts of content is also concerning, for Google as well as consumers. It's going to be really hard for humans and businesses to stand out online, and determining what is real or true is going to get very difficult when it comes to content, social media, and images and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4G6GNFz0O8' target='_blank'>videos</a>.

I asked ChaptGPT how we might go about detecting if a particular piece of content was generated from AI.

Here's what it said:

![](/img/2023-01-20/chat-gpt-detecting-ai-content.png)

This seems fairly accurate. It doesn't always read naturally, it can't reason, and it can indeed feel too perfect. It's not aware of branding styles nor does it have a personal voice. But it's pretty good, and it's still early.

It won't be long before the internet of today will not even be recognizable.

But it should be clear by now that even in the near-term the effects will be huge. We need to start changing our habits and behaviors online, and there's already a huge shift happening. 

Maggie Appleton has a <a href='https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest' target='_blank'>great article</a> where she discusses the impacts of AI on search results and its impact on being a human with an online presence, and knowing when you're interacting with an actual human.

I firmly believe most public social media platforms will before long become useless for most purposes. Who wants to spend time engaging with AI generated content? In turn, we'll continue to see a huge rise in walled online communities.


### Writing for business

ChaptGPT is already making many writers nervous. Especially in the cases of basic copywriting, content generation, product descriptions, and the like. I've already seen a number of writers express real concern about this.

In fact, my wife is currently writing product descriptions for a large apparel company that you've heard of, and the agency she's working though has an AI tool the writers are to use to write the first draft. The copywriter is then meant to tweak the output to suit the brand's identity, style, and tone. And this is where AI falls short today. However, these tools can be trained to learn, so when the ability to train these models gets accessible enough, that'll be game-changing yet again, and incredibly disruptive. It's at that point writers like her will rarely be needed.

### Creative writing and the arts

We weren't expecting AI to affect creative jobs so quickly, and there was hardly a mention of it until recently.
It turns out that AI is actually quite good at creative tasks, both in writing as well as generating graphics and images.

Even just a few years ago, the predictions of what AI would affect first almost never included creative pursuits. However, we're already seeing <a href='https://time.com/6240569/ai-childrens-book-alice-and-sparkle-artists-unhappy/' target='_blank'>published</a> books being written with AI.

If you have your doubts, <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html' target='_blank'>AI just won an art award</a>

### Education and the consequences of AI

AI is going to hit the education system hard, and universities are already <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/technology/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-universities.html?' target='_blank'>grappling with this</a>.

Why write a paper when you can just ask AI just write a better one in a few seconds? Want it simply articulated for a 5-year-old, or would you prefer it read like a legal document or scientific journal? Just say so.

Need the answer to a question that's beyond the capabilities of Google, or need some code written for you (and yes, I've already been using it for this)? Done.

It will be so easy to cheat (and it already is) that it seems almost hopeless to try to stop it. Trying to stay ahead of the technology in this way will be an enourmous feat for universities. They'll need to find a different way.

At the same time, the advancements in AI will greatly alter what is important to learn. For example, it's easy to argue now that communication skills are important, but ChatGPT arguably changes that.

I can just ask it to re-write a rude thought in a professional and polite way.

Let's try it:

![](/img/2023-01-20/chat-gpt.png)

Job saved, phew!

The invention of the calculator had similar effects. Yes, we still teach math in school, but the reality of it is that most of us only require the most rudimentary math skills in our day-to-day. And for anything we can't do in our head, we're going to pull out our phone and use the calculator, or ask Siri. 

I'm not saying we should stop prioritizing communication skills, or math, rather my intent is to highlight some of the questions this brings up.

Even before AI, the education system has a lot of overdue overhauling to do. It's an antiquated system at this point. But this change won't be led by the government or public school system, and probably not by the universities either. It'll take an Elon Musk type (or Elon himself), that comes along and flips the system on it's head. There are already rumbles of that happening with after-school courses like <a href='https://www.synthesis.com/' target='_blank'>Synthesis</a> (which, coincidentally or not, originated at SpaceX).

But who knows how long a transormation like that will take, and for a while it'll likely only be available to upper-class families who can afford expensive private schools.

This all re-inforces my main goal for my kids' education - my priorities for them do not revolve around them going to the best schools and getting the best grades, as much as developing an interest in learning and an ability to learn on their own. Armed with that, I believe they'll be fine.

### Finally, because you should be wondering:

None of this post was written with AI, except for the title:
