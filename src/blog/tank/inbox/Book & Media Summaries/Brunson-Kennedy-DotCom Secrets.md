## Highlights
Throughout this book, we’re going to talk more about creating the right bait. Right now, just realize the bait has to match what your dream customer wants. — location: [378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U3817WE&location=378) ^ref-63665

Question #4: What Result Do You Want To Give Them? Once you’ve hooked your dream customers with the perfect bait, the last question is what RESULT do you want to give them? I’m not talking about what product or service you want to sell them. A business is NOT about products and services. A business is about what result you can get for your clients. Once you (and they) understand that concept, then price is no longer a barrier. — location: [379](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U3817WE&location=379) ^ref-4922

Imagine that your clients could pay you anything to get a desired result. What, then, would you do to help guarantee their success? Where would you lead them? What does that place look like? Keep that place in your mind; it’s the pinnacle of success for your clients. It’s where you want to take them, and it’s the key to this last step. — location: [390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U3817WE&location=390) ^ref-10816

Because I had received value, I naturally wanted to move forward and get additional value from him. — location: [430](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U3817WE&location=430) ^ref-27399

This system does not work if all you have is one thing—like a book or an adjustment. — location: [525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U3817WE&location=525) ^ref-39233

A percentage of your audience will always want to pay you the premium to get more value. — location: [536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U3817WE&location=536) ^ref-60015

So instead of trying to convince someone to buy the most expensive offering right away, we build a funnel that will help us to do two things: 1 Provide value to each customer at the unique level of service that he or she can afford. 2 Make money and be profitable while identifying our dream clients who can afford our highest offer. — location: [572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U3817WE&location=572) ^ref-10302
