<p>The term Lean is often misunderstood as “being cheap.” While “being Lean” is fundamentally about eliminating waste or being efficient with resources, that interpretation is not completely misguided because money happens to be one of those resources. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B006UKFFE0&amp;location=246">246</a> ^ref-30437</p>

<p>Achieving product/market fit is the first significant milestone of a startup and greatly influences both strategy and tactics.
