The effect of our personal experiences and beliefs on our ability to make decisions.

We are good at explaining why we made mistakes in the past but doesn't help us from making mistakes in the future. Even knowing about them doesn't help. 
Source of cognitive biases: meta-bias. It's hard to see a system we are part of. Example: Ball on train. If on train, ball not moving, if watching train go by, ball moving at 60mph.

What to do:
Take yourself out of the equation, walk around the problem through different lenses.
