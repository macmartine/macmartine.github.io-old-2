One of the best methods for getting publicity, is by giving away content or your product for free. If free isn't an option, then super cheap. While we often want to maximize our sales, and get the most money per unit, but the opportunity cost is to miss out on getting momentum and getting the word out in the first place. If the product is cheaper and easier to use than the competition, the positioning should be enough to help it spread like wildfire,  more than if there's a lot of friction in the price. A higher price can cause enough friction that momentum cannot be reached. It's preferable to get momentum and a lower price.

In addition it's much easier to raise prices than to lower prices.
