## Highlights
These foods light up pleasure and reward centers in the brain for a different reason than nature intended—not because they provide vital nutrition, but because they are scientifically designed to stimulate our taste buds. The effect is a total disconnection between pleasurable, rewarding tastes (sweet, fatty, and salty) and the nutrition that always accompanies them in nature. — location: [411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=411) ^ref-37339

In nature, sweet tastes usually came from seasonal raw fruit, rich in vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Today, sweet flavors come from artificial sweeteners, refined sugars, and high-fructose corn syrup. In nature, fatty tastes usually came from meats, especially nutrient-packed organ meats. In modern times, fats come from a deep-fryer or a tub of “spread.” In nature, precious electrolytes like sodium came from sea life or from the animals we ate. In modern times, salt comes from a shaker. Do you see the problem with this? — location: [414](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=414) ^ref-39695

So unlike the prime rib, there are no “brakes” to decrease our want. We want the tenth Oreo just as much as the first. And we never stop wanting more because even though we’ve eaten plenty of calories, our bodies know that we are still seriously lacking in nutrition. So we eat the whole darn package because satiety can’t be fooled. — location: [461](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=461) ^ref-13783

While bone broths are not a dense source of protein, they do provide valuable amino acids not found in large quantities in muscle meat. — location: [2181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2181) ^ref-1953

First, buy the leanest cuts possible, and trim or drain all the visible fat. — location: [2227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2227) ^ref-30343

As you’ll see in a later chapter, we’re not fat-phobic, and we aren’t suggesting that you should eat nothing but lean meat. We just don’t like the toxins that come along for the ride in factory-farmed meat. — location: [2233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2233) ^ref-37406

organic. Different meats contain different vitamins and minerals, so the more you rotate the foods you eat, the better chance you’ll have of getting the full complement of micronutrients that make you healthier. — location: [2246](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2246) ^ref-49202

That being said, one large egg yolk does have almost 200 mg of cholesterol, and conventional wisdom says that since eggs are high in cholesterol, eating eggs every day will increase your blood cholesterol, leading to heart disease and stroke. — location: [2261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2261) ^ref-17468

Depending on your health and diet, your liver makes three to ten times more cholesterol than the amount that comes from your food. — location: [2266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2266) ^ref-13091

In addition, when we are under physical or psychological stress, cholesterol increases significantly—because cholesterol is an important precursor of cortisol. — location: [2270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2270) ^ref-19319

If you are going to eat processed meats, our same quality guidelines apply. Select foods from naturally raised and fed sources (grass-fed, pastured, wild-caught, and organic), and find brands that are minimally processed with ingredients you can pronounce. — location: [2318](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2318) ^ref-9529

In addition, bacon lovers must take the time to find a pastured, organic source. This — location: [2325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2325) ^ref-25340

But we suggest that you make raw fermented vegetables, like sauerkraut and kimchi, a priority. — location: [2399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2399) ^ref-5338

The Environmental Working Group issues an annual “Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides in Produce,” detailing the “dirtiest” (most contaminated with pesticide residue) and “cleanest” (least contaminated) produce items. If you’re on a tight budget, purchase organic for the dirtiest of the dirty and conventional for the rest. For items that aren’t on either list, do the best you can, given the produce available and your budget. (For the full list from the Environmental Working Group, visit www.ewg.org/foodnews.) — location: [2426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2426) ^ref-48761

If the item of produce has an inedible skin, or you’re going to peel it before you eat it, it’s less important to buy organic; if you can’t peel it (like lettuce or grapes), consider spending the extra money for organic. — location: [2431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2431) ^ref-35375

Unrefined coconut oil is ideal for cooking, and most varieties don’t transmit a strong coconut flavor to your food. — location: [2676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2676) ^ref-46482

Create each meal around your protein source. Each meal should include one to two palm-size servings of protein. As often as possible, choose high-quality meat, seafood, and eggs. — location: [2892](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2892) ^ref-61205

Start with one to two servings of fruit a day. A serving is about the size of a fist. — location: [2958](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2958) ^ref-4464

Feel free to add some fruit either with your meals or immediately after. — location: [2960](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2960) ^ref-8341

it’s better to eat smaller servings of fruit throughout the day than a large amount in one sitting. — location: [2969](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2969) ^ref-352

Choose one or more fat sources per meal. — location: [2997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008C20TDG&location=2997) ^ref-24728
