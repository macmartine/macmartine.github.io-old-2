## Highlights
“Ultimately, happiness comes down to choosing between the discomfort of becoming aware of your mental afflictions and the discomfort of being ruled by them.” — location: [195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG63&location=195) ^ref-1544

This is something that can happen again and again via meditation: accepting, even embracing, an unpleasant feeling can give you a critical distance from it that winds up diminishing the unpleasantness. — location: [351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG63&location=351) ^ref-25945

Imagine if our negative feelings, or at least lots of them, turned out to be illusions, and we could dispel them by just contemplating them from a particular vantage point. — location: [362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG63&location=362) ^ref-23343

There’s something to be said for this point of view. In fact, one of the take-home lessons of Buddhist philosophy is that feelings just are. If we accepted their arising and subsiding as part of life, rather than reacting to them as if they were deeply meaningful, we’d often be better off. Learning to do that is a big part of what mindfulness meditation is about. And there are lots of satisfied customers who attest that it works. — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG63&location=438) ^ref-21960
