## Highlights
In his editorial “It’s the Cholesterol, Stupid!,” Dr. Roberts argued (as noted earlier) that there is only one true risk factor for coronary heart disease: cholesterol.27 You could be an obese, diabetic, smoking couch potato and still not develop atherosclerosis, he argues, as long as the cholesterol level in your blood is low enough. — location: [601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=601) ^ref-36710

cooked. Endotoxins are not destroyed by cooking temperatures, stomach acid, or digestive enzymes, so after a meal of animal products, these endotoxins may end up in your intestines. They are then thought to be ferried by saturated fat across the gut wall into your bloodstream, where they can trigger the inflammatory reaction in your arteries.44 — location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=680) ^ref-16974

The American Dietetic Association (ADA), which produces a series of nutrition fact sheets with guidelines on maintaining a healthy diet, also has its own corporate ties. Who writes these fact sheets? Food industry sources pay the ADA $20,000 per fact sheet to explicitly take part in the drafting process. So — location: [757](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=757) ^ref-28968

In 2012, the American Dietetic Association changed its name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics but didn’t appear to change its policies. It continues to take millions of dollars every year from processed junk food, meat, dairy, soda, and candy bar companies. In return, the academy lets them offer official educational seminars to teach dietitians what to say to their clients.64 — location: [761](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=761) ^ref-58413

Greek ptosis, falling, and apo, away from). In a sense, your body is rebuilding itself every few months16 with the building materials you provide it through your diet. Some cells, however, overstay their welcome—namely, cancer cells. — location: [892](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=892) ^ref-43464

So how does curcumin affect this process? It appears to have the ability to reprogram the self-destruct mechanism back into cancer cells. All cells contain so-called death receptors that trigger the self-destruction sequence, but cancer cells can disable their own death receptors. Curcumin, however, appears able to reactivate them. — location: [896](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=896) ^ref-40814

When fat is heated to frying temperatures, whether it be animal fat, such as lard, or plant fat, such as vegetable oil, toxic volatile chemicals with mutagenic properties (those able to cause genetic mutations) are released into the air.22 This happens even before the “smoke point” temperature is reached.23 If you do fry at home, good ventilation in the kitchen may reduce lung cancer risk.24 — location: [912](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=912) ^ref-44299

While eating a bowl of pea soup or dipping carrots into hummus may not seem like eating beans, it is. You should try to get three servings a day. A serving is defined as a quarter cup of hummus or bean dip; a half cup of cooked beans, split peas, lentils, tofu, or tempeh; or a full cup of fresh peas or sprouted lentils. — location: [6524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6524) ^ref-35553

A serving of berries is a half cup of fresh or frozen, or a quarter cup of dried. — location: [6528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6528) ^ref-60835

---
For other fruits, a serving is a medium-sized fruit, a cup of cut-up fruit, or a quarter cup of dried fruit. — location: [6532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6532) ^ref-27020

I recommend at least one serving a day (typically a half cup) and at least two additional servings of greens a day, cruciferous or otherwise. — location: [6537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6537) ^ref-24143

---
Serving sizes for other greens and vegetables are a cup for raw leafy vegetables, a half cup for other raw or cooked vegetables, and a quarter cup for dried mushrooms. — location: [6538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6538) ^ref-59393

A serving of whole grains can be considered a half cup of hot cereal such as oatmeal, cooked grain such as rice (including the “pseudograins” amaranth, buckwheat, and quinoa), cooked pasta, or corn kernels; a cup of ready-to-eat (cold) cereal; one tortilla or slice of bread; half a bagel or english muffin; or three cups of popped popcorn. — location: [6543](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6543) ^ref-11742

Legumes were given special treatment, straddling both the protein and the vegetable groups. They’re loaded with protein, iron, and zinc, as you might expect from other protein sources like meat, but legumes also contain nutrients that are concentrated in the vegetable kingdom, including fiber, folate, and potassium. You get the best of both worlds with beans, all the while enjoying foods that are naturally low in saturated fat and sodium and free of cholesterol. — location: [6582](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6582) ^ref-5813

But soy milk and even tofu are processed foods. — location: [6597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6597) ^ref-4940

---
If you do eat tofu, choose varieties made with calcium (you’ll see it in the ingredients list), which can weigh in at a whopping 550 mg of calcium per (3 oz) slice.2 — location: [6599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6599) ^ref-33034

---
Even better than tofu, though, would be a whole soy food like tempeh, which is a type of fermented soybean patty. — location: [6602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6602) ^ref-25063

I do like to slice it thin, dip it into a thick flax “egg” mixture (see here for my recipe), dredge it through some rosemary-seasoned whole-grain bread crumbs or coarse blue cornmeal, and bake it in my toaster oven at about 400°F until golden brown. Then I dip it in buffalo hot sauce for a healthier approximation of the chicken wings I enjoyed in my youth. — location: [6603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6603) ^ref-21996

choose organic soy products, — location: [6642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6642) ^ref-43209

The bottom line is that there is no direct human data suggesting any harm from eating GMO crops, though such studies haven’t been done — location: [6643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6643) ^ref-32531

Making miso soup can be as easy as mixing one tablespoon of miso with two cups of hot water and whatever vegetables you prefer. — location: [6655](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6655) ^ref-60103

There are two principal reasons to avoid salt: stomach cancer and high blood pressure. — location: [6666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6666) ^ref-27631

---
But it’s not just sodium-rich animal products like processed meats and salted fish that are associated with higher stomach cancer risk—pickled plant foods are as well. — location: [6674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6674) ^ref-17027

---
Edamame is about as whole a soy food as you can get. After all, these are soybeans still in their pods. — location: [6697](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6697) ^ref-13496

---
Lentils are already one of the most nutrient-dense legumes. But when sprouted, their antioxidant power doubles (and even quintuples for chickpeas). — location: [6719](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6719) ^ref-12512

---
Why add protein powder to your smoothies when you can add sprouted lentils? — location: [6722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6722) ^ref-33878

---
a sprouting jar, or simply a mason jar covered with cheesecloth secured with a rubber band, soak lentils overnight in water, drain, and then rinse and drain twice daily for another couple of days. Sprouting to me is like gardening on steroids—I can create fresh produce in three days right on my kitchen counter. (Of course, if you open a can of lentils, you can enjoy them in about three seconds.) — location: [6723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6723) ^ref-19477

---
A recent study discovered that indeed canned beans are as healthy as boiled beans—with one exception: sodium. Salt is often added to canned beans, resulting in sodium levels up to one hundred times more than if you cooked them without any salt.38 — location: [6728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6728) ^ref-36520

---
Draining and rinsing your canned beans can remove about half the added salt, but then you’d also be rinsing away some of the nutrition. — location: [6730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6730) ^ref-51218

And don’t forget other bean blending, from garlicky white bean spreads and pinto pâtés to spicy black bean dip. — location: [6742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6742) ^ref-52286

starts with toasting some corn tortillas. (Food for Life, the same company that makes Ezekiel bread, makes a sprouted yellow corn tortilla usually sold in the frozen section.) — location: [6759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6759) ^ref-30152

---
Then I mash some canned beans on them with a fork and add a spoonful or two of jarred salsa. All the better if I have fresh cilantro, salad greens, or avocado to top it all off. — location: [6760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00Y7USB14&location=6760) ^ref-35488
