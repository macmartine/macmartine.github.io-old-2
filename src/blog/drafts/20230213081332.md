 it doesn't take a genius to come up with a good idea. It takes noticing those ideas. Noticing when there's not a tool to make your problem easy. Noticing for some thing is hard thing to be made easier. Stephen king in "on writing" says I just don't come from sitting around the table they just come to you   says I just don't come from sitting around the table they just come to you. 
The prolific fantasy and science fiction author Neil Gaiman was once asked where he gets all his ideas. “From daydreaming,” he said. “You get ideas from being bored.” From random episodic silent thinking. “The trouble these days is that it’s really hard to get bored. I have 2.4 million people on Twitter who will entertain me at any moment…it’s really hard to get bored.” If there’s any difference between him and less creative people, he said, “I’m much better at putting my phone away, going for boring walks, actually trying to find the [time and] space to get bored in. That’s what I’ve started saying to people who say ‘I want to be a writer,’ I say, ‘great, get bored.’”
