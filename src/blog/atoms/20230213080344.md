As the captain of a ship, you're responsible for a lot of things.

Fires are among the worst things that can go wrong.

Confidence that you can put them out, isn't enough, here's why:

Fires can have detrimental effects to your ship and everyone on it.

If a fires starts, and you and your crew put it out, is that something to be proud of?

Maybe slightly.

By the time the fire started, it was too late, and all you could do was try to put it out, so good on you. The outcome could have been significantly worse if you hadn't.

However, the fire should have been prevented in the first place.

Running a smooth ship is the mark of a good captain.

Put the work in now to avoid the disasters.

You may feel like a silent hero in a world where public heroes get more attention, but it's time to stop thinking like that.

Silent heroes win in this world.
