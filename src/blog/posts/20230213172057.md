# Get started off right with "free or cheap"

## Goal

Don't let price be a friction point in getting your product off the ground.

If the product is cheaper and easier to use than the competition, the positioning should be enough to help it spread like wildfire,  more than if there's a lot of friction in the price.

Getting your first customers is hard.

Determining where to price your product is hard. And the only way to really know what will work is to experiment. However, you can only experiment once you have found a way ot get people's attention. 

So where do you start? 

If you start with your price too high, you'll never get off the ground, and you might not know what the problem is.

One approach to making both of these easier, is to start off with free or cheap.It can be hard to stomach, giving the product you've worked so hard on, for so little. After all, you *know* it's worth more.

Let's look at the potential outcomes for our options:
### Approach: Price too high
Result: No customers

Outcome: 1) Eventually lower your prices 2) Product dies

### Approach: Price too low
Result: No customers

Outcome: This isn't really possible, as the price isn't too low if you still aren't getting customers. Or you haven't found a way to get your product in front of people, in which case your price doesn't matter anyway.

### Approach: Price too low
Result: Lots of customers

Outcome: It's possible you could have made more money per unit, but it's better than the alternative of being priced too high and not getting customers. And by getting a initial stream of customers you're building momentum, the word is getting out, and you can incrementally increase your prices. After all, increasing your prices is easy. Lowering them is hard.

## Other options

Depending on your offering, there are various options here.

In both informational products and software, you can:
* Offer the product free for a period
* Offer a steep early-bird discount
* Give a portion of your product away for free - a free chapter, or a limited feature version of your software.


## Conclusion

While we all want to get the most money per unit for our product, it's important to consider the opportunity costs.

More customers at a lower price, is far better than no customers at a higher price. The momentum gained, and the word of mouth that will result, and that first wave of income will put you in a great position to iterate, incrementally raise prices, and grow.
