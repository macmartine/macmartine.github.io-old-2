Over the weekend I was looking back at some of the countless apps I've built.

I totally cringed at some of the terrible ideas, and even lazier execution.

Then I realized something...

Being a bit embarrassed by our past work is not something to be ashamed of, rather it should be a goal.

It's a sign of progress. Of growth. And that's something to be proud of.

Do the best work you can today, then tomorrow, strive to do something even better. 

Hope to look back and be proud of how far you've come.
