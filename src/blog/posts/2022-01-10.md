## {{ title }}

Last week I joined [Daniel Vassallo's](https://twitter.com/dvassallo) [Small Bets Community](https://smallbets.co), Cohort 21.

Last night was the first call of 6 to kick it off.

I was surprised to see 132 people in the call - as there's a new cohort starting every two weeks. Daniel's crushing it!

There seemed to be people from all over the world with all types of backgrounds and ideas - authors, tech people, some who sells solder kits. I noticed [Dru Riley](https://twitter.com/DruRly) of [Trends.vc](https://trends.vc), which I'm also a part of, was in there too, which was cool to see.

A lot of Daniel's ideas and approach are influenced by [Nassim Taleb's books](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21559.Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb), who I've been a fan of for years. Though, I still haven't gotten through all his books because the ones I have read I've read multiple times. It's really interesting discussing applying Taleb's research on randomness and probability to building a business.

Daniel proposes never being all in on any one idea, to always diversify. To "treat ideas like cattle, not pets".

It's similar to something I've been saying lately, which is "believe in your idea, but don't be married to it". Daniel takes this a few steps further in suggesting we almost constantly have a flow of ideas that we're trying out. And those ideas can't truly be validated until you actually try it.

We discussed how there's a level of randomness in business, largely based on human behavior that cannot be predicted, or assumed, and that it only takes one variable to be off for a business to fail that would otherwise succeed.

This idea is similar to what I've done over the past 15 years, in the sense that I've experimented frequently with lots of different ideas until something sticks. However, my approach has been more linear where I'd mainly focus on one idea at a time.

There's no one right way to build a business, but this is certainly an interesting approach and there are certainly some convincing arguments to taking this route.

Looking forward to the future sessions.
