## Don't Let a Bad Decision Derail Your Future: How to Avoid Mistakes

One spring weekend, when I was 16, two friends of mine made the decision to ruin the next ten years of their lives, with aftershocks that would rattle on much longer.

In exchange for 30 minutes of “fun”, they gave up being able to go out and enjoy their remaining teenage years and beyond. They were left cleaning up the mess they had made, both for themselves, their families, and the others involved. Much of the next few years was spent under house arrest, making court appearances, and racking up astronomical legal bills for their parents to cover. Not to mention the effects these convictions would have on their abilities to get certain jobs or go to certain schools.

All this for making the consequential and irreversible decision to steal the school principal’s car, drive it into a stone wall, and throw rocks through the windows.

Most of us wouldn’t do such a thing, and sure, they were rebellious teens. But you know adults doing other versions of the same thing – putting hurdles in front of themselves by the poor decisions they make.

We are faced with countless decisions on a daily basis. Knowing how to determine which ones have the biggest consequences, and how to effectively make address them, is what separates high-performing, highly successful individuals from those spending their time fixing and repairing.

Fortunately there are some basic steps we can take to ensure we put our energy on the important decisions, to help pave the way for a future driven by forward momentum, not held back by unnecessary friction.

### Identify what’s consequential and irreversible
Each decision we are faced with falls somewhere between being inconsequential and consequential, and reversible and irreversible.

Decisions that are consequential and irreversible are classified as Type 1 decisions, and this is where we want to spend the majority of our decision-making energy. Anything else falls into a Type 2 decision and can be made with intuition or be delegated.

This framework originated in a 2016 Amazon shareholder letter:

> "Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before."

You can take any decision you're faced with place it somewhere on the following matrix:

With this in mind, let’s go through the process of finding what decisions deserve our time.

## Finding the lead domino

Armed with this basic framework, we can smooth the way for a better future. This is often referred to as finding the “lead domino”. A lead domino is a decision that will make other decisions that follow, easier. If given proper attention, it will create a future of less problems, not more.

To find out lead domino, we start off by placing all the decisions we’re currently faced with in one of the following categories.

**Reversible and consequential:**

Examples:

* Whether or not to give your child their own phone
* Hiring your first employee
* Starting a new relationship

Goal: While you could always just try the thing you're considering, and reverse the decision later, you could instead start by gathering information. Ask others that have faced the decision before how they decided and what the outcome was.

**Irreversible and consequential:**

Consequential and irreversible decisions are those that could alter the outcome of your life, where there’s no going back. 

Examples:

* Deciding whether or not to have kids
* Deciding to spend your life savings on starting a new business
* Getting a face tattoo

Goal: These are where you want to spend most of your decision-making time and energy.

**Reversible and inconsequential:**

These are the least important decisions of all. The effects are insignificant and reversible.

Examples:

* What color you paint your room
* How you arrange your furniture
* Which email client to use

Goal: Decide quickly with intuition, or delegate. 

**Irreversible and inconsequential:**

Some decisions are irreversible but the outcome will never be life-altering.

Examples:

* Where you choose to spend your vacation
* What you have for lunch
* Which book you read next

Goal: Decide quickly with intuition, or delegate. 

Once we’ve identified the important decisions worthy of our time, we need to strive for the best outcome.

### How to make a good decision:

## Step 1: Slow down

Slowing down gives your brain space to move beyond gut instinct, and allows your subconscious to get to work. It allows you time to fully understand the problem, and not make a rash decision.  

Give yourself as much time as you need, and remember that if you don’t, it could end up costing much more time and energy in the future.

## Step 2: Gather information
Gather as much information as you can to help you make a well-educated decision. 

If you are debating whether or not to quit your job to start your own business, talk to people who have done it. Find people who succeeded as well as failed, and form a well-rounded view of the potential outcomes.

## Step 2: Try things out
In many cases there’s a way to get your feet wet instead of diving in head first.

If you’re considering buying a house across the country, but aren’t convinced that’s where you want to be, vacation there a few times. Or rent before buying. 

If you are deciding whether or not to have kids, talk to some parents, offer to babysit. Get in the weeds a bit and see how it feels.

## Step 4: Think long-term

One of the easiest things to overlook in making big decisions is what the consequences could be in the future. We don't want to trade a more difficult future for an easier now.

Take the time to picture the worst possible outcome of a poor decision, and remember that your future self will thank you. It’s much easier to deal with a difficult decision now, than the rippling effects of a poor decision tomorrow.

### Summary

A little time spent now can literally alter the trajectory of your life in a positive way.

Take the time to identify those decisions you are faced with that are consequential and irreversible. Confidently move quickly on less-important decisions, and commit more time and effort to making smart, educated decisions where it really matters. It’ll pay in dividends.
