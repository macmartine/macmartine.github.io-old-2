A digital garden in a place where thoughts can grow, and be expanded on over time. Whereas blogs as websites often present data chronologically, and data is relevant to the current moment and fades, a digital garden is more geared towards flushing out ideas and thoughts over time. Content isn't always evergreen, but is timeless content is often preferred.

A good digital garden often creates a sort of choose-your-own-adventure where each reader is likely to choose a different path based on what's interests them. While most web pages have links, digital gardens are densely linked with references and associations that make them more exploratory.
