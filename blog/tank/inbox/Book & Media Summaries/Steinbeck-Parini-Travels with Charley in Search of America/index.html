<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>out. It was like starting to write a novel. When I face the desolate impossibility of writing five hundred pages a sick sense of failure falls on me and I know I can never do it. This happens every time. Then gradually I write one page and then another. One day’s work is all I can permit myself to contemplate and I eliminate the possibility of ever finishing. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001BC6GN6&amp;location=595">595</a> ^ref-5797</p>
