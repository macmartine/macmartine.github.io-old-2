<p>Time, according to a quantum physicist</p>
<p>Who is Carlo Rovelli</p>
<p>Time according to Carlo Rovelli</p>
<p>What is time?
Does time exist?
When did it start?
When will it end?
Speed of time based on location
Where time is useful
Where time is not useful
What can we take away from this</p>

<p>What is time? Does it even exist? When did it start, and when will it end?</p>
<p>Looking into the future, it feels like there's no option but for it to continue on infinitely, while looking into the past, it only makes sense that it had a beginning. A similar thing happens when we think about the creation of the universe - it's hard to imagine the universe having existed infinitely into the past, yet we can't imagine it disappearing in the future. If it does, what will be left behind?</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, time is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the continued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence" title="Sequence">sequence</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence" title="Existence">existence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(philosophy)" title="Event (philosophy)">events</a> that occurs in an apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_process" title="Irreversible process">irreversible</a> succession from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past" title="Past">past</a>, through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present" title="Present">present</a>, into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future" title="Future">future</a>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will make sense to most of us, and how we think about time - as a long sequence of events.</p>
<p>Diving into this deeper, we can determine that time only exists in the presence of a past and a future. And that the concept of past and future only exist through conciousness. More specifically, through memories. For, without memories, we have no concept of past, we're instead locked into the &quot;now&quot;. And without knowledge of the past, there's no way to have a concept of a future.</p>
<p>This leads us to a place where time only exists for concious beings. Those who are able to observe a sequence of events, and recall them. We can therefore say that without concious life, time does not exist.</p>
<p>Time does not work the way we think of it working. It is not a unique sequence of events. There's no sense in which the universe is all in the present.</p>
<p>As Carlo Rovelli says &quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Two watches in different locations show different times / go at different speeds. Time goes faster the further away from big objects.
We can currently measure a difference at about 32 inches.
So, time between any two points is different. But differences on earth are small. If you go near a bigger mass, time will go faster and the differences will be bigger.
Time will eventually stop down near a black hole.
This is how you would time travel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time between two clocks is also affected by how they move. Speed slows down time. Consequence: It's impossible to say the same time between any two points
Now in once place is not the same as now in another. By the time I see what you're doing, it took time for the light to travel, and by the time I see it you're in a new now. We see things in the past. Small affects on earth, but gets bigger the further apart.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It makes no sense to ask what's happening in the far distant universe right now.
&quot;Now is a local notion&quot;</p>
<p>No way to record time in an objective way. Every object moving has it's own time. Every bubble in space has it's own time.</p>

<li>Laws of physics have a hard time distinguishing past from future. Whatever can happen in one direction can happen in the other. Play movie in reverse. But in our world there is a difference in past vs future. One equation that does differentiate it is heat / temperature. Second law of thermodynamics. Entropy only grows, does not decrease. No distinction between past and future without temperature. Movie of pendulum in reverse, can't tell which is fwd/back. Same with video of solar system. But if wait til it slows down and play backwards, you can tell. The friction stopped it, the heat Something that stops shows past vs future. Ordered motion of molecules moving makes disorder molecules around it. Order, causing disorder. This is the physical meaning of 2nd law of thermodynamics. This is the only thing that distinguishes past from future - that things were ordered and caused disorder. Who ordered them? We don't know.</li>
<li>Structure of time is governed by gravity. Gravity slows down time.
Quantum mechanics implies small fluctuations in time and space. So the idea of a single time variable doesn't work anymore.</li>
</ol>
<p>Up and down are uncontroversial, yet there is no up and down in the universe.
It's relative.</p>
<p>How do we think about the world without time?
No time doesn't mean things are frozen. It's the opposite. Things happen, but not in time. Events occur, but not synced together on a given time scale. We can have multiple clocks that have multipe times. &quot;There is no preferred time all over the universe.&quot;</p>
<p>Cannot identify events at different times.
We should not think of the world as a set of objects, but a process, a sequence of events.
Of events happening.</p>
<p>We should think of the world as a sequence of events happening with respect to one another.</p>
<p>34:37</p>
<p>Where does this idea of time come from?</p>
<p>Start from a world without time.</p>
<p>Quantum gravity describes world in the very small which we can't see. So our vision of the world is blurred.</p>
<p>We have a very limited view of this very complex world. So in this blurred version of reality, we see heat. At a basic level if you just look at the molecules moving around, there is no heat.</p>
<p>&quot;The difference between the past and the future has to do with the way we interact with the world. It's not just in the world, it's in the perspective between us and the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of what we think about te world, is just in our perspective. Stars moving at night, sun rising. The universe isn't turning, we are.</p>
<p>The same happens in time.</p>
<p>&quot;Time isn't the clock the goes around, it's exactly the memories of the past.&quot;
We can remember the past and intuit the future.</p>
<p>Music only exists because we can remember what came before any given note, and we can even anticipate what's coming. Otherwise, at any given moment we're only hearing one note. So we latch onto something that happened in the past, and something we anticipate in the future. And this occurs in our brain, and has nothing to do with physics. Music is not something that exists outside of our heads.</p>
<p>Time is not a neutral notion for us. Time is our identity. But also our good and bad emotions of ourselves. We suffer because we lose things. The emotional component is largely what we're talking about when we talk about time. Time is what takes away everything to us.</p>
