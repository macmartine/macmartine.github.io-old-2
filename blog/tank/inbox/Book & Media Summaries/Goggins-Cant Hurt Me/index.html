<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>remember my very first day in the gym back in Indiana. My palms were soft and quickly got torn up on the bars because they weren’t accustomed to gripping steel. But over time, after thousands of reps, my palms built up a thick callous as protection. The same principle works when it comes to mindset. Until you experience hardships like abuse and bullying, failures and disappointments, your mind will remain soft and exposed. Life experience, especially negative experiences, help callous the mind. But it’s up to you where that callous lines up. If you choose to see yourself as a victim of circumstance into adulthood, that callous will become resentment that protects you from the unfamiliar. It will make you too cautious and untrusting, and possibly too angry at the world. It will make you fearful of change and hard to reach, but not hard of mind. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07H453KGH&amp;location=1716">1716</a> ^ref-18053</p>

<p>Similar to using an opponent’s energy to gain an advantage, leaning on your calloused mind in the heat of battle can shift your thinking as well. Remembering what you’ve been through and how that has strengthened your mindset can lift you out of a negative brain loop and help you bypass those weak, one-second impulses to give in so you can power through obstacles. And when you leverage a calloused mind like I did around the pool that day and keep fighting through pain, it can help you push your limits because if you accept the pain as a natural process and refuse to give in and give up, you will engage the sympathetic nervous system which shifts your hormonal flow. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07H453KGH&amp;location=1762">1762</a> ^ref-45161</p>

<p>The sympathetic nervous system is your fight or flight reflex. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07H453KGH&amp;location=1767">1767</a> ^ref-17578</p>

<p>Those mornings when going on a run is the last thing you want to do, but then twenty minutes into it you feel energized, that’s the work of the sympathetic nervous system. What I’ve found is that you can tap into it on call as long as you know how to manage your own mind. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07H453KGH&amp;location=1769">1769</a> ^ref-56422</p>

<p>if you can manage those moments of pain that come with maximum effort, by remembering what you’ve been through to get to that point in your life, you will be in a better position to persevere and choose fight over flight. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07H453KGH&amp;location=1772">1772</a> ^ref-59563</p>

<p>The reason it’s important to push hardest when you want to quit the most is because it helps you callous your mind. It’s the same reason why you have to do your best work when you are the least motivated. That’s why I loved PT in BUD/S and why I still love it today. Physical challenges strengthen my mind so I’m ready for whatever life throws at me, and it will do the same for you. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07H453KGH&amp;location=1791">1791</a> ^ref-52193</p>

<p>The engine in a rocket ship does not fire without a small spark first. We all need small sparks, small accomplishments in our lives to fuel the big ones. Think of your small accomplishments as kindling. When you want a bonfire, you don’t start by lighting a big log. — location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B07H453KGH&amp;location=2459">2459</a> ^ref-30071</p>
