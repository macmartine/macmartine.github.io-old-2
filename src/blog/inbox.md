> **Lazy time encourages diffuse thinking.** Our mind has two modes of thinking: the diffuse mode and the focused mode of thinking. We need to maintain constant oscillation between the two modes in order to be our most creative and productive. [Mind wandering](https://nesslabs.com/mind-wandering), a form of diffuse thinking, is a useful mechanism for our brains to process information—sometimes leading to non obvious solutions. Another benefit of letting our mind wander without paying any attention to a productive task is a higher focus on long-term goals, according to a [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233768331_Letting_go_of_the_present_Mind-wandering_is_associated_with_reduced_delay_discounting) published in _Consciousness and Cognition_. A bit of lazy time today, for a more productive time tomorrow!
