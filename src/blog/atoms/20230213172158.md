Influencers can have a big impact in promoting your product, however, the best way to ask them to promote it is to not ask. Find a way for your product to make them look awesome. So instead of thinking about how to reach your audience, think about how to make your audience look awesome, or better yet, make them be awesome.

If you need to ask, you're better off asking people that get less asks. Instead of targeting the biggest of names, ask those that would be flattered to be asked.
