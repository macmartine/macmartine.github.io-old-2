Humans learn through their lifetime in a largely non-linear way, focusing on various topics at different times in their lives, with all types of miscellaneous knowledge squeezing itself at all times.

There are times when we may feel that we lack in a particular area, or want to know more about a particular topic as a whole, and this is where Wikipedia's [Vital Articles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles) can be an incredible resource. There are 5 levels, of decreasing importance. The first level contains 10 articles, of large, general topics. The second level has 100 articles, and so on, ending with 50,000 articles in level 5. 

It's a great way to start with an overview of a subject and get increasingly in depth in whatever are you choose.
