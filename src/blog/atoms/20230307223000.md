The hardest part of any important task isn't the task itself.

It's getting started.

Here's all you have to do to get those things done:

If you should be writing, just sit down at the desk.

If it's yoga, just step on the mat.

Whatever it is, just get started, from there, the motivation will happen naturally.

Reminder to slow down and enjoy what you're doing.

The most important thing is having fun. If you're not, you should be doing something else.
